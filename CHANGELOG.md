# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added — security
- Web dashboard auth refactor: scrypt-hashed passwords (per-password random salt), random session tokens persisted to `data/web-sessions.json`, `crypto.timingSafeEqual` everywhere.
- **Fail-closed by default**: a fresh install no longer falls through to "open access" if no password is set — every API call returns 503 and every page redirects to a setup wizard.
- WebSocket upgrade handshake validates the same session cookie as REST.
- `helmet`, `express.json({limit:'256kb'})`, `express-rate-limit` on `/api/login` (10 / 15-min / IP).
- Path safety on `/api/file` and `/files/*`: NUL-byte rejection, `path.normalize`, `fs.realpath` symlink check, default `Content-Disposition: attachment`.
- Per-blob random scrypt salt for AES session storage (wire format v=2, v=1 still decrypts).
- LICENSE, SECURITY.md, vulnerability disclosure policy.
- `docs/AUDIT.md` — full 166-finding audit with severity table.

### Added — web parity
- First-run password setup + change-password flow entirely from the browser; CLI is no longer required for security setup.
- 4-step web wizard for adding Telegram accounts (label → phone → OTP → 2FA).
- Account list / remove from Settings → Telegram Accounts.
- `/api/monitor/{status,start,stop}` + Settings → Engine card with live state, queue, active workers, uptime.
- History backfill from the Group settings modal (one-tap 100 / 1k / 10k).
- Dialogs picker covers archived chats and (opt-in) DMs.

### Added — features
- **Download by Link** (`POST /api/download/url`): paste any `t.me/.../<msg>`, `/c/<id>/<msg>`, `/c/<id>/<topic>/<msg>`, `tg://resolve`, or `tg://privatepost` URL and pull just that media.
- **Telegram Stories** (Xinomo parity): username + per-story selection, queued through the regular downloader.
- **TTL/self-destructing media**: monitor detects `media.ttlSeconds` and front-loads the queue so the file is captured before expiry.
- **Forum topics**: per-group filter list with whitelist mode.
- **Proxy** (SOCKS4/5 + MTProxy) wired into the GramJS client; Settings UI with TCP-reachability test.
- **Light / Dark / Auto theme** with OS-detected default, persisted in localStorage.
- **Browser notifications** opt-in for download-complete events.
- **Sticky status bar**: monitor state, queue, active workers, total files, disk usage, WS link.
- **Gallery search + multi-select + bulk delete**, including server-side `searchDownloads()`.

### Added — engine
- Dual-lane queue (`_high` realtime + `queue` history) — realtime no longer competes with backfill; spillover only displaces history.
- `core/runtime.js` singleton orchestrates monitor + downloader + forwarder in-process for the web server.
- WebSocket client (`ws.js`) with auto-reconnect and visibility-aware backoff.
- Connection manager `stop()` + monitor cleanup tracking; intervals are `unref`-ed so the process can exit cleanly.
- Backpressure max-wait in history (5 minutes) so a stuck downloader can't hang the command forever.

### Changed
- `runner.js` and `watchdog.ps1` now read `TGDL_RUN` env (default `monitor`) instead of hard-coding `history` — production supervision actually keeps a long-running process alive.
- gramJS internal noise (`TIMEOUT`, `Not connected`, `Reconnect`, etc.) is now classified instead of silently dropped: it logs to `data/logs/network.log` and only surfaces in stderr when `TGDL_DEBUG=1`.

### Fixed
- Terminal raw-mode is restored on `exit` / SIGINT / SIGTERM — no more dead shells on crash.
- Plaintext apiId no longer printed at CLI startup.
- `.gitignore` malformed line removed; `docs/` and `CLAUDE.md` are now tracked.
- Orphan `src/index.js_fragment_setupWebAuth` deleted.

### Migration notes
- Old `config.web.password` (plaintext) is auto-rehashed to `config.web.passwordHash` on first successful web login.
- Old AES blob format (`v=1`) keeps decrypting; new writes are `v=2`.
- Existing `data/db.sqlite` is migrated forward automatically — `ttl_seconds` and `file_hash` columns are added on first start.
