# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.6.4] — 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- **Share v2 URLs returning "Invalid share link"** — route handler still expected the legacy `?exp=&sig=` shape; URL builder generates `?s=<sig>` (v2). Handler now accepts both, looks up the row first, and verifies the sig against the stored `expires_at`. Filename slug routes (`/share/<id>/<filename>?s=…`) also work.
- **Stale CSS in production** — `<link href="/css/main.css?v=2.6.0">` was hard-coded. Newer releases shipped CSS classes (`.share-maint-toolbar`, `.log-src-chip`, `.ai-hero`) that the SW kept serving from the v2.6.0 cache. The cache-bust rewriter now covers `/css/` paths too, and the `<link>` no longer carries a stale literal version.

### Added
- **HuggingFace access token field** on `/maintenance/ai`. Set it from the web instead of needing `HF_TOKEN` in env. Stored in `config.advanced.ai.hfToken`; both NSFW and AI capability loaders read it.

### Internal
- SW bumped `v263` → `v264`.

## [2.6.3] — 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- **pHash write crash** — "The bound string, buffer, or bigint is too big". `setPhash` now bit-casts the unsigned 64-bit hash into the signed 64-bit range SQLite can store, and `listAllPhashes` reads in `safeIntegers(true)` mode so values outside JS Number's 2^53 envelope round-trip cleanly. Hamming distance still works at the bit level (the helper masks back to 64 bits before XOR).
- **AI model loads behind 401 / rate limits** — every transformers.js fetch now sends an `Authorization: Bearer …` header when `HF_TOKEN` (or `HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN` / `HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN`) is set in env. Lets operators pull gated repos + dodge anonymous rate-limit walls.
- **Docker smoke test exit 127** — bookworm-slim runtime image was missing `procps`, so the CI smoke test's `docker exec smoke ps -o user=,comm=` returned 127. `procps` is now installed in the runtime stage (~500 KB).

### Internal
- SW bumped `v262` → `v263`.

## [2.6.2] — 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- **NSFW default model swapped** to `AdamCodd/vit-base-nsfw-detector`. The previous default `Falconsai/nsfw_image_detection` is PyTorch-only — its `onnx/` directory 404s, so transformers.js can't load any of the dtype variants (q8/fp16/fp32/q4 all fail). AdamCodd ships full ONNX coverage and is the de-facto transformers.js NSFW classifier.
- Operators on a fresh install no longer hit "Could not locate file" preload errors out of the box.

### Internal
- SW bumped `v261` → `v262`.

## [2.6.1] — 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- NSFW model load — default `dtype: 'q8'` (quantized) + auto-fallback through fp16/fp32/q4 when the chosen variant isn't on the HF CDN.
- Queue rows missed the duplicate flag — `runtime._serializeJob` now propagates `deduped`; rows render a "Duplicate" tag + a Duplicate filter chip.
- `confirmSheet` accepts both `{message,confirmLabel,danger}` and `{body,confirmText,destructive}` (half the call sites silently dropped options before).
- Service Worker `/js/` strategy flipped to network-first so stale `.js` can't outlive a deploy. Bumped `v260` → `v261`.
- Trimmed verbose Maintenance-card help text.

### Added
- NSFW: model-id input + precision picker + Preload-now button + Preload-on-start toggle + Wipe cached weights. Endpoints: `POST /api/maintenance/nsfw/preload`, `GET /api/maintenance/nsfw/model-status`, `DELETE /api/maintenance/nsfw/cache`.
- AI master switch + per-capability toggles on `/maintenance/ai`.
- Settings chip-nav — 10 chips per top-level card with IntersectionObserver-driven active state.
- Active share links modal — stats grid + sticky toolbar + filter chips + Cleanup-expired bulk action + polished row design (state pill, Open/Copy/Revoke 28×28).
- Logs filter chips — branded toggle pills with per-source coloured dot + live count badge + All/None.
- Duplicates page — bulk "Keep oldest / Keep newest / Clear" toolbar.
- Install-update button disables + relabels to "Up to date" when on the latest release.
- Verify-files done event also lands in the bell notification list.

### Changed
- Per-tool settings moved to per-tool maintenance pages (no duplicate in Settings → Advanced).
- Backfill page patches active rows in place on WS progress (was full innerHTML rewrite per tick).
- AI hero search drops purple accent — uses Telegram blue, label-above-chip layout, disabled mic removed.
- Thumb-miss warning: 15-min window + 200-miss floor + 30-min cooldown + opt-out toggle (~2/h instead of ~60/h).
- `notify-clear-btn` icon-only.

### Internal
- New config keys: `advanced.nsfw.dtype`, `advanced.nsfw.preload`, `advanced.thumbs.warnMisses` (allow-list-validated).
- New WS events: `nsfw_model_downloading`, `ai_model_progress`.
- `setupAutoSave` binds at `<body>` so per-tool settings cards autosave through the same pipeline.

## [2.6.0] — 2026-05-04

### Added — Single-row Maintenance hub
- **Sidebar collapsed from 6 maintenance entries to 1.** A new `#/maintenance` hub page renders every tool as a card grid (1 / 2 / 3 columns by viewport) with live status pills wired to the WS progress channel. Per-feature deep links (`/maintenance/duplicates`, `/maintenance/nsfw`, etc.) still resolve directly so power users keep their muscle memory.
- New `src/web/public/js/maintenance-hub.js` (~120 LOC) — coalesced WS dispatcher + status hydration on (re-)entry.
- Mobile + desktop both benefit; the previous 5+ rows dominated the sidebar at every viewport.

### Added — Local AI search & smart organisation (opt-in)
- **Semantic search** — CLIP image+text embeddings (`Xenova/clip-vit-base-patch32`, ~90 MB, WASM). `POST /api/ai/search { query }` returns top-K rows ranked by cosine similarity.
- **Face clustering ("People")** — YOLOv5n-face detector + CLIP-on-crop embeddings + DBSCAN. Admin can rename clusters and browse photos per person.
- **Auto-tag** — ImageNet classifier (`Xenova/mobilenet_v2`, ~14 MB) writes top-K labels per photo into `image_tags`. Powers the tag cloud + #tag filter on the new page.
- **Perceptual dedup (pHash)** — DCT-based 64-bit hash, no model required. Groups near-duplicates by Hamming distance; reuses the existing dedup-delete pathway.
- New page `#/maintenance/ai` with toggles, scan progress, search, tag cloud, people grid, and near-duplicate groups. Default-OFF; every capability is gated by `config.advanced.ai.<cap>.enabled`.
- 12 endpoints under `/api/ai/*`, all admin-only and JobTracker-driven (returns 200 immediately, WS progress).
- Models lazy-loaded into `data/models/` (override with `AI_MODELS_DIR`); fresh installs pull zero AI weights.
- Optional `sqlite-vec` fast-path auto-detected at boot; in-memory cosine fallback covers libraries up to ~50k photos.
- Documentation: `docs/AI.md` (architecture, models, troubleshooting); `docs/DEPLOY.md` env-var table updated; README "Why people use it" bullet added.
- 17 new tests under `tests/ai/`: pHash determinism + Hamming distance, vector-store BLOB round-trip + cosine + top-K ordering, DBSCAN cluster isolation.

### Added — Gallery + viewer polish
- Right-click context menu on gallery tiles (Open / Download / Copy link / Share / Pin / Forward / Delete); `ContextMenu` key fires the same menu on the focused tile.
- Pin / unpin per file (star icon on every tile) + a "Pinned" filter chip in the gallery type strip + opt-in "Surface pinned at the top" library setting.
- Drag-drop a `t.me/...` URL anywhere on the dashboard → auto-queue download with a dashed-border drop overlay.
- Bulk **Download ZIP** button on the selection bar — streams a STORE-mode archive (multi-GB safe, no archive ever lives in RAM).
- Mini-player — sticky bottom-right preview that keeps a video clip playing after the viewer modal is closed; click to expand back. Opt-in via `viewer-shrink-on-close` localStorage flag.
- In-app changelog viewer — overlay sheet that fetches `/CHANGELOG.md` and renders a markdown-parsed timeline, triggered by clicking the version chip in the status bar.
- Locales: new `gallery.context.*`, `favorites.*`, `viewer.pip.*`, `viewer.selection.*`, `dragdrop.*`, `prefs.*`, `tour.*`, `changelog.viewer.*`, `groups.accent_color`/`groups.description`/`groups.rename_inline`, `storage.breakdown.*` keys in `en` + `th`.

### Added — Power-user / accessibility
- Screen Wake Lock during downloads — feature-detected via `navigator.wakeLock`; auto-acquires when a job is in flight, releases when the queue drains, re-acquires on tab visibility-change.
- System notifications on download complete + click-to-focus dashboard. New `notifyGeneric(title, body)` helper for one-shot finished events.
- Keyboard shortcut customisation — `localStorage['tgdl-shortcut-overrides']` lets users rebind every shortcut; new exports `loadShortcutOverrides`, `setShortcutOverride`, `effectiveShortcuts`, `resetShortcutOverrides` from `shortcuts.js`.
- High-contrast mode — `@media (prefers-contrast: more)` block in `main.css` plus a manual `html[data-contrast="more"]` toggle.

### Added — Server endpoints
- `POST /api/downloads/:id/pin { pinned: bool }` — toggle the `pinned` column. Broadcasts `download_pinned` over WS.
- `POST /api/downloads/bulk-zip { ids: [...] }` — streams a ZIP attachment of every requested file. Cap: ~4 GiB total + 65 535 entries (no ZIP64). Filename: `tgdl-<group>-<count>files-<ts>.zip`.
- `GET /api/downloads/all?pinned=1&pinnedFirst=1` and `GET /api/downloads/:groupId?pinned=1&pinnedFirst=1` — opt-in pinned filter / sort.
- `GET /CHANGELOG.md` — read-once Markdown serve for the in-app viewer (admin + guest), 1-hour `must-revalidate` cache.

### Added — DB
- `setDownloadPinned(id, pinned)` and `getDownloadById(id)` in `src/core/db.js`.
- `getAllDownloads` / `getDownloads` accept `{ pinnedOnly, pinnedFirst }` opts; existing callers behave identically.

### Performance
- **Hash worker pool** — new `src/core/hash-worker.js`. SHA-256 streaming on a `worker_threads` pool (default `min(8, ⌊cpus/2⌋)`, `HASH_WORKER_POOL_SIZE` overrides). Wired into `core/downloader.js` and `core/dedup.js` so multi-GB hashing no longer blocks the main event loop.
- **HTTP compression** — optional `compression` middleware enabled via `createRequire` (gracefully no-ops if the package isn't installed). Skips already-compressed media (`image/*` / `video/*` / `audio/*`). `COMPRESSION_LEVEL` env var (default 6).
- **Static asset caching** — `/icons/*` joins `/css/*` and `/js/*` in the 1-year `immutable` Cache-Control bucket when the request carries the `?v=`. `/locales/*` gets `must-revalidate` for translation freshness.
- **`<link rel="modulepreload">`** for the SPA's hot-path import graph (`app.js`, `api.js`, `ws.js`, `router.js`, `i18n.js`, `store.js`, `utils.js`).
- **Streaming bulk ZIP** — pure-JS PKZIP writer (`src/core/zip-stream.js`) with backpressure-aware piping so a 5 GB selection writes through to the response sink without buffering.

### Tests
- `tests/perf-headers.test.js` (8) — Cache-Control assertions for `/css/`, `/js/`, `/icons/`, `/api/*`, `/sw.js`, `/locales/*`, `/files/*`.
- `tests/hash-worker.test.js` (5) — known SHA-256 round-trip across the pool, in-process streamer, concurrent requests, missing-file rejection, `HASH_WORKER_DISABLE=1` fallback.
- `tests/zip-bulk.test.js` (3) — EOCD parse, STORE-mode round-trip across multiple files, `safeArchiveName` invariants.
- `tests/shortcut-overrides.test.js` (6) — defaults, override persistence, replacement, reset, malformed JSON tolerance, defensive type filtering.

### Docs
- `docs/DEPLOY.md` — env var rows for `HASH_WORKER_POOL_SIZE`, `HASH_WORKER_DISABLE`, `COMPRESSION_LEVEL`.
- `README.md` — two new bullets under "Why people use it" (gallery polish + perf passes).

## [2.5.0] — 2026-05-04

### Added — Universal background-job pattern
- **`src/core/job-tracker.js`** — single-flight orchestration primitive every long-running admin endpoint now wraps. Exposes `tryStart(runFn)` (returns `{started:true}` or 409 `ALREADY_RUNNING`), `cancel()` via AbortController, `getStatus()` snapshot, automatic WS broadcast of `<kind>_progress` + `<kind>_done`, plus `log()` integration. **Cloudflare-safe by construction**: every wrapped POST returns ≤500 ms.
- **13 endpoints converted** to fire-and-forget — previously any of these could time out behind a 100 s reverse-proxy: `files/verify`, `db/vacuum`, `db/integrity`, `restart-monitor`, `resync-dialogs`, `dedup/delete`, NSFW v2 bulk-{delete,whitelist,unwhitelist,reclassify} (shared tracker), `thumbs/rebuild`, `auto-update`, `groups/refresh-info`, `groups/refresh-photos`, `groups/:id/purge` (multi-flight per id), `purge-all`. Each gets a `/status` companion, a WS event prefix, and a frontend that hydrates state on init.
- **`src/web/public/js/job-buttons.js`** — frontend helper. `wireJobButton({ btn, statusUrl, eventPrefix, runUrl })` — one binding, six call sites in Settings. Hydrates from `/status` on mount, listens to WS, handles 409 by re-hydrating instead of erroring.
- **Multi-client coordination**. Start a `Build all thumbnails` on a phone → desktop's button immediately disables. Cancel from desktop → both clients re-enable. State lives on the server, every client is a renderer.
- **Cancel + abort threading**. Long jobs accept an `AbortSignal`; clicking Cancel stops the worker within seconds.
- 14 new tests (`tests/job-tracker.test.js` + `tests/job-tracker-multi-client.test.js`) — single-flight, 409 path, abort propagation, two virtual WS clients receive the same payload.

### Added — Backup destinations (NAS-style multi-provider mirror + snapshot)
- **`#/maintenance/backup`** — full-page admin surface for off-host backups. Cards-grid layout with per-destination Run / Pause / Test / Edit / Remove buttons + recent-jobs strip + WS-driven live state.
- **Three first-class providers**: S3-compatible (covers AWS / Cloudflare R2 / Backblaze B2 / MinIO / Wasabi from one driver via `@aws-sdk/client-s3`), local filesystem / NAS mount, SFTP (`ssh2-sftp-client`).
- **Three modes per destination**: `mirror` (every `download_complete` enqueues a job), `snapshot` (cron-scheduled tar.gz of `db.sqlite` + `config.json` + `sessions/`, retains last N copies on the remote), `manual` (only fires on `POST /run`).
- **Persistent retry queue** — DB-backed (`backup_jobs`), exponential backoff (capped 30 min), max-attempts giveup, boot-time recovery of stuck `uploading` rows.
- **Optional client-side encryption** — AES-256-GCM with a per-destination salt + PBKDF2-SHA256 (200k) key derivation. Passphrase lives in process memory only; restart re-prompts via the dashboard's Unlock action. File format: `magic 'TGDB' | version | iv | ciphertext | tag`.
- **Credentials encrypted at rest** — provider configs in `backup_destinations.config_blob` are AES-256-GCM-encrypted under a KEK derived from `config.web.shareSecret`.
- **Endpoints**: `GET/POST /api/backup/destinations`, `PUT/DELETE /:id`, `POST /:id/test|run|pause|resume|encryption|unlock`, `GET /:id/status|jobs`, `GET /api/backup/jobs/recent`, `POST /api/backup/jobs/:id/retry`, `GET /api/backup/providers`.
- **WS events**: `backup_destination_added/updated/removed`, `backup_progress`, `backup_done`, `backup_error`, `backup_queue_drained`.
- **Stub providers** for FTP / Google Drive / Dropbox — wizard pickers list them as "coming soon"; their dependencies are `optionalDependencies` so default installs stay slim.
- **`BACKUP_WORKERS_PER_DEST`** env var (default 3) caps per-destination concurrency.
- 20 new tests (encryption round-trip, credentials encrypt/decrypt with rotation, queue retry timing, local-provider full I/O); 2 S3 tests skipped without `MINIO_TEST_ENDPOINT`.

### Changed — Share-link URL format (v2.5)
- **`/share/<linkId>?exp=<sec>&sig=<43chars>`** → **`/share/<linkId>/<filename>?s=<43chars>`**. The expiry is now read from the DB row (single source of truth), the URL drops `?exp=` entirely, and a sanitised filename segment makes downloads land with a sensible name. The HMAC still binds `(linkId | exp_at_issue)`, so URLs minted before this release continue to verify cleanly — backwards compatible.
- **Telegram-themed error page** (`src/web/public/share-error.html`) — friends who hit an expired / revoked / bad-sig / not-found / file-missing link now get a branded card with icon, friendly title, and explanation instead of the raw `{"error":"Share link is not valid","code":"expired"}` JSON. Browsers get the HTML; `Accept: application/json` callers keep the JSON for backwards compat. Status code stays `401` so external scanners can't enumerate which link ids are valid.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v240'` → `'v250'` (semver-aligned for v2.5.x line). Service worker shell pre-cache picks up the new `share-error.html` automatically.

### Docs
- New `docs/BACKUP.md` — full provider walkthroughs, encryption / passphrase management, restore procedure, cost notes per provider.
- `docs/DEPLOY.md` — `BACKUP_WORKERS_PER_DEST` env var documented; share-link URL format note.
- `README.md` — backup bullet under "Why people use it", updated keywords.

## [2.4.0] — 2026-05-04

### Added — Maintenance pages (4 admin-only surfaces)
- **`#/maintenance/duplicates`** — full-page Find Duplicates: scan, group-by-hash review table, per-row keep/delete, bulk "keep oldest / newest", inline Re-index button. Replaces the in-Settings sheet.
- **`#/maintenance/thumbs`** — full-page Build Thumbnails: cache stats, fire-and-forget build with WS progress (`thumbs_progress`/`thumbs_done`), wipe-cache action, ffmpeg capability badge.
- **`#/maintenance/nsfw`** — full-page NSFW review with **5-tier dynamic logic** (def_not / maybe_not / uncertain / maybe / def, boundaries 0.3 / 0.5 / 0.7 / 0.9). Stats cards, score histogram (vanilla SVG), per-tier paginated list, per-row Keep / Delete / Whitelist / Re-classify, bulk-action toolbar, scan controls. Replaces the binary above/below threshold review.
- **`#/maintenance/logs`** — realtime server log viewer (admin). Subscribes to the new WS `log` channel + backfills the in-memory ring buffer via `GET /api/maintenance/logs/recent`. Filter by source / level, search, pause, autoscroll, download `.log`. Stops you from needing `docker logs` for routine debugging.
- All four pages enforce admin via `ADMIN_ROUTE_PREFIXES` (`router.js`) + `data-admin-only` (CSS gate) + the existing server-side `guestGate` middleware.

### Added — Re-index from disk
- **`POST /api/maintenance/reindex`** + companion `/status` — walks `data/downloads/` and `INSERT OR IGNORE`s catalogue rows for files the DB doesn't know about (idempotent on `(group_id, message_id)`). Recovers from a wiped DB without re-downloading from Telegram. Fire-and-forget, broadcasts `reindex_progress` + `reindex_done`. Surfaced from `/maintenance/duplicates`.

### Added — Realtime log channel
- **`log({ source, level, msg })`** helper in `src/web/server.js` writes into a 1000-entry ring buffer and broadcasts a `log` WS message. Mirrors to stdout/stderr so the docker-logs path keeps working. Used by NSFW scan progress, thumbs build, dedup, reindex, and a thumb-miss tally.
- **Notification bell** in the content-header — surfaces warn / error events from the WS `log` stream. Badge count, persisted last-50 in `localStorage`, browser tab title flash on important events while the tab is hidden, "Clear all" action.

### Added — HEIC display + sharp 0.34
- **HEIC / HEIF inline transcode** — `/files/<path>?inline=1` for `.heic` / `.heif` returns a JPEG via sharp + libvips libheif (built into sharp 0.34). Cached at `data/thumbs/heic-cache/<sha-of-path-and-mtime>.jpg`; raw bytes still serve when `?inline=1` is absent. iPhone uploads now preview in the gallery instead of falling into the "documents" bucket.
- `core/downloader.js` recognises `.heic` / `.heif` / `.gif` as `photo`, `.webm` as `video`, `.opus` / `.flac` as `audio`.

### Added — `npm run doctor` (diagnostics CLI)
- One-shot runtime check: Node version + ABI, config load, `better-sqlite3` open + row count (with `npm rebuild` hint on `NODE_MODULE_VERSION` mismatch), `data/` writability, port availability (honours `PORT`), `ffmpeg` on `PATH`. Cross-platform, non-interactive — safe for CI / Docker. Exits `1` on any blocking failure.

### Added — Auto-save Settings (debounced)
- Every Setting input now writes to `/api/config` 800 ms after the last edit, no scroll-to-Save round trip required. Inline status indicator: idle → "Editing…" → "Saving…" → "Saved at HH:MM:SS" with an ARIA-live region for screen readers. Tab-hide and field-blur flush early so unsaved edits don't vanish on tab close. The manual Save button stays as an early-flush escape hatch.

### Added — Mobile content-header overhaul
- Header restructured for narrow viewports: paste-link / stories / view-mode / refresh collapse into a `⋮` overflow menu at <640 px. Subtitle hidden, avatar/title shrunk, engine pill icon-only at <380 px. Always-visible cluster: menu / avatar / title / engine pill / 🔔 bell / select-mode.
- Per-page header icon (settings → ⚙️, queue → ✅, maintenance pages → relevant icons) — replaces the bug where a previously-selected group's photo bled across pages.

### Added — Force HTTPS hardening
- Confirm sheet on enable (defends against accidental clicks that lock the operator out of a fresh dashboard with no TLS cert behind it).
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` on every secure response when Force HTTPS is on.
- New TLS-lockdown section in `docs/DEPLOY.md` with pre-flight checklist.

### Changed — Architecture
- **CSS extracted from `index.html`** — the inline `<style>` block (1525 lines) is now `src/web/public/css/main.css`, served via `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/main.css?v=2.4.0">`. Service worker preloads it via `SHELL_URLS`. `index.html` shrunk from 3847 → 2325 lines (-1522). Easier to edit, browser + SW cache the stylesheet independently of HTML changes. Future split into per-concern files (theme / layout / gallery / components) is queued for v2.4.1.
- **Docker base image: `node:20.20.2-alpine` → `node:20.20.2-bookworm-slim`.** `onnxruntime-node` ships glibc-only prebuilt binaries — alpine's musl libc could not load them, so containers died at boot with `Error loading shared library ld-linux-x86-64.so.2`. Bookworm-slim has glibc out of the box. `apk` swapped for `apt-get`, `su-exec` for `gosu` (drop-in equivalent), entrypoint path `/sbin/tini` → `/usr/bin/tini`. Image grows ~40 MB but actually runs.
- **`docker-compose.yml` defaults `TRUST_PROXY=1`** — most Docker deployments are behind a reverse proxy, and without this the rate-limiter floods stderr with `ERR_ERL_UNEXPECTED_X_FORWARDED_FOR` validation warnings on every request.
- **Background-job pattern** — `thumbs/build-all`, `dedup/scan`, `nsfw/scan`, `reindex` all return 200 immediately and stream progress via WS. Companion `/status` endpoints (`/dedup/status`, `/thumbs/build/status`, `/reindex/status`, `/nsfw/status`) let a re-opened page recover the live state without polling. Closing the tab no longer kills work in flight.
- **Lint cleanup** — dead code removed across core / web / scripts / tests (`directoryCache`, `normalizeName()`, `hasMissingKeys`, debug `RAW EVENT` block + `peerId` derivation, unused imports `Api` / `closeTopSheet` / `api` / `escapeHtml` / `getFileIcon` / `insertDownload`, unused `chatId` / `lastCrashTime` / `DB_PATH`, destructured `id` → `_id`). Net `-19` warnings, no behaviour change.

### Fixed
- **`navigateTo is not defined` race on first click** — the inline `onclick="navigateTo('…')"` handlers on sidebar nav-items would throw whenever `loadGroups()` / `loadStats()` rejected before app.js's `init()` finished, because the `window.navigateTo = …` assignments lived after the await chain. Hoisted the entire `window.*` exposure block to right after the synchronous bootstrap so the bindings are live the moment the module finishes parsing — independent of any later network failure.
- **Backfill flashing "Done" milliseconds after Start** — `core/history.js` swallowed errors via `catch + emit('error')` then unconditionally `emit('complete')` in `finally`, so the Promise returned by `downloadHistory` resolved cleanly no matter what failed. The most common surface was "no available account can read this group" — operators saw a green "Done" pill with zero downloads. The catch now re-throws after emitting so server.js's `.then() / .catch()` actually routes failures to `history_error`. Added log channel emission with a hint for the most common cause (no account in group).
- **Backfill failures invisible on the realtime log channel** — both the user-triggered (`POST /api/history`) and the auto-spawn (first-add bootstrap, post-restart catch-up) paths now emit a structured `log` event with the group name, group id, and a friendly hint when the message points at account access.
- **Sidebar `chat-row` overlapping the sticky search input on scroll** — the sidebar groups header was at `z-10` and the avatar's type-badge inside `chat-row` was also `z-10`. Source-order made the chat-rows win on scroll-up. Bumped the sticky header to `z-20`.
- **Downloaded Groups all showing the megaphone icon regardless of type** — `/api/groups` and `/api/downloads` didn't carry `type`, so the avatar fell back to an id-prefix heuristic (every `-100…` id ⇒ channel) which conflated supergroups with channels. Both endpoints now enrich rows with `type` from the dialogs cache (channel / group / user / bot), matching what Manage Groups already shows.
- **`opacity: 0` on cached thumbnails leaving tiles permanently invisible** — the lazy-loader was setting `el.src = el.dataset.src` BEFORE attaching `onload`, which meant cached images fired their `load` event synchronously before the handler attached, so the `.loaded` class was never added and CSS kept the tile at `opacity: 0`. Handler now attaches first; we also add `el.complete` recovery for the same-tick race and an `onerror` fallback so broken thumbs don't stay invisible either.
- **Disk-usage footer reading stale "930 KB" after Purge all** — when the DB sum is zero (catalogue empty / freshly purged) `/api/stats` now walks `data/downloads/` recursively for the real on-disk size and refreshes `disk_usage.json` instead of trusting the legacy snapshot.
- **`tests/db.test.js` no longer touches the user's real `data/db.sqlite`** — the test now points the DB module at an `os.tmpdir()` mkdtemp via the new `TGDL_DATA_DIR` env override and removes the directory in `afterAll`.
- **Header avatar bleed** — clicking a group in the sidebar then navigating to Settings used to leave that group's photo in the header. Reset on every page change + per-page icon mapping.
- **Engine pill queue-count badge invisible on small phones** — the `<380 px` icon-only collapse zeroed `font-size` for the whole pill including the inline queue-count digit. Restored `font-size: 10px` on the badge inside the same media query.
- **Maintenance Thumbs page auto-completing the build before it finished** — `POST /thumbs/build-all` is fire-and-forget but the page treated the immediate 200 as completion (rendering "Built undefined / undefined" toasts), then failed any subsequent click with a 409. Now the page kicks off the build, waits for `thumbs_done` over WS, and recovers in-flight state via `GET /thumbs/build/status` on re-mount so closing the tab + coming back resumes the progress bar.
- **Maintenance Logs viewport overflow on landscape mobile** — `height: calc(100vh - 320px) min-height: 320px` evaluated negative on a 360 px-tall viewport and the min-height fallback then cropped the bottom rows under the bottom nav. Switched to `clamp(240px, calc(100vh - 320px), 70vh)`.
- **Maintenance Logs search jank** — full re-render of the 1 000-line buffer fired on every keystroke. Debounced 150 ms.
- **Empty gallery left with no actionable hint** — the "ทำไมบางกลุ่มไม่เจอ media" pattern. The empty state now shows a contextual title + body + admin action buttons (Run Backfill / Group Settings / Re-index from disk for per-group, Add account / Manage groups for all-media), so the operator knows where to go next.
- **Cloudflare 524 timeout on `/api/maintenance/dedup/scan`** — the SHA-256 sweep was awaited inside the POST handler, so on a 50 GB library the request could outlast Cloudflare's 100 s tunnel timeout long before completing. Converted to the same fire-and-forget pattern as thumbs / nsfw / reindex: 200 immediately, progress + final result via WS (`dedup_progress` / `dedup_done`), recovery via `GET /dedup/status`. Closing the tab no longer cancels the scan; opening the page from another device shows the live progress.
- **`onnxruntime-node` glibc crash defended at the process level** — even with the Dockerfile on bookworm-slim and the dep moved to `optionalDependencies` (see below), an existing install with the broken module on disk could still emit `Error loading shared library ld-linux-x86-64.so.2` and bring the process down via unhandledRejection. Added an explicit guard in `src/web/server.js` (and `src/index.js` for the CLI) that recognises native-load failure messages and logs once-and-survives instead of crashing.
- **`ERR_ERL_UNEXPECTED_X_FORWARDED_FOR` validation warning storm** — express-rate-limit v7's self-help diagnostic ran on every request when `trust proxy` was at the default `false`. We now default `trust proxy` to `'loopback'` (overridable via `TRUST_PROXY` env), and we explicitly disable the `xForwardedForHeader` + `trustProxy` validators on the rate-limiter since we configure trust proxy correctly ourselves. Other validators stay enabled.

### Changed — Cross-platform support
- **`@huggingface/transformers` → `optionalDependencies`.** It transitively pulls in `onnxruntime-node`, whose Linux prebuilds are glibc-only and crash on musl images (alpine) at module load. Moving it out of `dependencies` means `npm install` on any platform is safe by default; the NSFW review feature is now an opt-in install (`npm install @huggingface/transformers`). `npm run doctor` reports availability so operators know whether the feature is wired up.

### Changed — Build thumbnails state shape
- Field names in `_thumbBuildState` and the `thumbs_progress` / `thumbs_done` WS payloads aligned with what `buildAllThumbnails()` returns: `processed / total / built / skipped / errored / scanned`. Replaces the placeholder `done / errors` keys, which made the maintenance log line read `done=undefined errors=undefined`.

### Changed — Multi-client coordination
- Maintenance pages (Find duplicates, Build thumbnails, NSFW scan, Re-index) now hydrate from `GET /<feature>/status` on (re-)entry. Starting a long-running job on a phone now disables the corresponding button on the desktop client too — and vice versa — because state lives on the server and the front-end is a renderer.
- **Express `ERR_ERL_UNEXPECTED_X_FORWARDED_FOR` warning spam** — silenced by the `TRUST_PROXY=1` default in `docker-compose.yml`.

### Changed — DB
- **`src/core/db.js` honours `TGDL_DATA_DIR`** — set the env var to relocate the data root (used by the test isolation above; also lets Docker / multi-instance deploys override the path without symlinks). Default behaviour unchanged.
- New tier-aware NSFW APIs: `getNsfwTierCounts`, `getNsfwHistogram`, `getNsfwListByTier`, `reclassifyNsfw`, `unwhitelistNsfw`. Tier dictionary exported as `NSFW_TIERS`.

### Changed — Dependencies
- **`sharp ^0.33.5` → `^0.34.5`** to dedupe with the nested copy `@huggingface/transformers` already pulls in. node_modules sheds the duplicate libvips and platform binaries. Bonus: HEIC / HEIF input + output now available out of the box.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v48'` → `'v240'` (semver-aligned for the v2.4.x line). `/css/main.css` added to `SHELL_URLS` so the new stylesheet preloads on install.

### Docs
- `docs/DEPLOY.md` — new "Force HTTPS (TLS lockdown)" section with pre-flight checklist.
- `docs/DEPLOY.md` — `TGDL_DATA_DIR` documented in the env vars table.
- `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` — `npm run doctor` documented as the first stop.
- `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` — `npm run doctor` in the CLI cheatsheet + contributor onboarding.

## [2.3.48] — 2026-05-02

### Added
- **`npm run doctor`** — runtime diagnostics in one command. Reports Node version + ABI, config load, `better-sqlite3` open + row count (with rebuild hint on `NODE_MODULE_VERSION` mismatch), `data/` writability, port availability (honours `PORT`), and `ffmpeg` on `PATH`. Cross-platform (Windows / macOS / Linux), non-interactive — safe for CI / Docker. Exits 1 on any blocking failure.

### Fixed
- **Disk-usage footer no longer reads stale "930 KB" after Purge all** — when the DB sum is zero (catalogue empty / freshly purged) `/api/stats` now walks `data/downloads/` recursively for the real on-disk size and refreshes `disk_usage.json` instead of trusting the legacy snapshot. The old cache was written sparingly by earlier downloader versions and never invalidated on purge, so a wiped dashboard could keep footer-reporting a multi-week-old size.

### Changed
- **`tests/db.test.js` no longer touches the user's real `data/db.sqlite`** — the test now points the DB module at an `os.tmpdir()` mkdtemp via the new `TGDL_DATA_DIR` env override and removes the directory in `afterAll`. Previously a local `npm test` would create + delete the production DB file under `data/`.
- **`src/core/db.js` honours `TGDL_DATA_DIR`** — set the env var to relocate the data root (used by the test isolation above; also lets Docker / multi-instance deploys override the path without symlinks). Default behaviour unchanged.
- **`sharp ^0.33.5` → `^0.34.5`** to dedupe with the nested copy `@huggingface/transformers` already pulls in. Same `rotate()` / `resize()` / `webp()` patterns we use are stable across the bump; node_modules sheds the duplicate libvips and platform binaries.
- Lint cleanup: dead code removed across core / web / scripts / tests (`directoryCache`, `normalizeName()`, `hasMissingKeys`, debug `RAW EVENT` block + `peerId` derivation, unused imports `Api` / `closeTopSheet` / `api` / `escapeHtml` / `getFileIcon` / `insertDownload`, unused `chatId` / `lastCrashTime` / `DB_PATH`, destructured `id` → `_id` in accounts/history/monitor). Net `-19` warnings, no behaviour change.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v47'` → `'v48'`.

## [2.3.47] — 2026-05-02

### Fixed — Guest scope (strict viewer)
- **Guest is a strict read-only viewer** — browse downloaded media, adjust their own appearance / video-player preferences (browser-side), sign out. Operational surfaces (Groups picker, Backfill, Queue, Engine, Maintenance, Advanced, Accounts, Rate Limits, Size Limits, Privacy/DM, Proxy, web-auth Security) are admin-only on both the front and the back.
- **Guest GET 403 on every read endpoint** — `app.use('/api', guestGate)` strips the `/api` prefix from `req.path`, so the allowlist (written with full paths) missed every entry. Now reads `req.baseUrl + req.path` and matches. Without this fix even the legitimate guest reads (downloads, groups list, stats, thumbs) returned 403.
- **`/settings` root reachable for guest** so they can use the Look & Feel chip; `/settings/<section>` deep-links honour the existing `GUEST_SETTINGS_SECTIONS` allow set (`appearance`, `video-player`).
- Settings chip-nav: System / Accounts / Downloads / Privacy & Net chips and their sections gain `data-admin-only` — guest sees only the Look & Feel chip + section.
- `#status-bar` (desktop bottom status bar) gains `data-admin-only` — its content (engine state, queue counters, WS link) is admin-info only; guest's disk/file count is in the sidebar footer.
- Admin-only init paths gated for guest in `app.js` and `settings.js` — `initStatusBar`, `initOnboarding`, `initQueue`, `initEngine`, `refreshRescueStats`, `POST /api/groups/refresh-info` all skip for guest sessions so the console stays clean.
- **Onboarding banner suppressed for guest** — JS guard in `initOnboarding` plus `body[data-role="guest"] #onboarding-banner { display: none }` belt-and-suspenders.

### Fixed — Other
- **`Cannot access '_configCache' before initialization`** crash on boot — the share-secret bootstrap IIFE awaited `readConfigSafe()` before the `let _configCache` declaration. Variable hoisted above the IIFE.
- **"Failed to load dialogs"** when no Telegram account is configured replaced with a friendly empty-state + "Add account" CTA. Server now returns `error: 'no_account'` (vs. `not_connected`) so the SPA can branch on intent.
- Settings page `<h2>` section labels removed — they duplicated the chip-nav identity. Cleaner, denser layout.

### Changed — UI polish
- **`login.html` restyled to match the dashboard theme** — brand mark on a Telegram-blue gradient disc, full `--tg-*` token swap, IBM Plex font, remixicon, soft radial glow, complete light/dark theme parity.
- **Settings tab strip: sticky-but-integrated.** `var(--tg-bg)` background sits inside the page column (no full-bleed banner), stays reachable while scrolling, doesn't read as a foreign component.
- **Sidebar gains a full-width red Sign out button** at the bottom (below the Disk/Files stats). Routes through `confirmSheet` so an accidental tap can't kick the operator out. The deeper Settings → Privacy & Net → Security → Sign out path stays for the dedicated flow.
- **Media search bar dropped from the Viewer page.** The standalone `<input id="media-search">` toolbar at the top of the gallery was rarely used — the sidebar's Downloaded Groups filter narrows by chat, the URL link picker handles "this exact message", and removing the bar gives the grid a full row of vertical real estate. The `/` keyboard shortcut to focus it is gone with it. The `Select` button moved into the page header next to Refresh, and only shows on the Viewer page (`body[data-page="viewer"]` gate).

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v46'` → `'v47'`.

## [2.3.46] — 2026-05-02

### Changed — Settings tab strip: drop sticky + integrate with page flow
- Settings nav no longer sticky — sits flush with the page in the normal scroll flow, same pattern as the Groups page tabs (`#groups-tab-*`) and the Viewer media tabs. The sticky version floated as a foreign banner; the new version reads as part of the page header.
- Margin breakout (`-12px / -16px`) removed; the underline now lives within the page's content column instead of spanning the whole content area like a separator.
- Active indicator moved from `::after` pseudo to the chip's own `border-bottom` so the underline overlaps the nav's `border-bottom` cleanly (the standard tab-into-content pattern).
- Inactive icons drop to `opacity: 0.75` and snap to full opacity on hover/active — gives the row a calmer rest state.
- Font weight bumped to 500, padding tightened to `10px 14px` to read as proper tabs rather than buttons.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v45'` → `'v46'`.

## [2.3.45] — 2026-05-02

### Changed — Settings tab-strip redesign
- Settings section nav redesigned from solid pill-chips to flat underlined tabs. The pill chips fought the muted cards below them; the tab-strip sits flat against the page and matches the existing `.tab-item` pattern used by Viewer media tabs and the Group settings modal.
- Active state is `var(--tg-blue)` text + 2 px underline (no heavy fill). Sticky bar carries a single bottom border that doubles as the inactive baseline. Mask-image edge fade dropped — overflow-scroll is silent on phones, and the row fits flush on tablet+.
- HTML markup unchanged; CSS-only redesign on `.settings-chip-nav` + `.settings-chip`.

### Changed — Sidebar groups header breathing room
- Toggle button padding tweaked to `pt-3 pb-1.5` (was `py-2`) so the "Downloaded Groups" heading sits with proper top breathing room and connects more snugly to the search row below.
- Search row padding upgraded `px-2 pb-2` → `px-3 pt-1 pb-3` so it aligns horizontally with the toggle and gets honest bottom space before the chat list begins.
- Search input grew `py-1.5` → `py-2` for a more comfortable tap target.
- Sticky header now carries a soft `border-tg-border/40` bottom edge so it visibly separates from the scrolling list once the user scrolls.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v44'` → `'v45'`.

## [2.3.44] — 2026-05-02

### Fixed — Light/dark theme contrast pass
- **`--tg-*` CSS variables are now actually defined.** Every `var(--tg-…)` consumer (`.engine-status-pill`, `.media-item`, `.sheet-card`, `.chat-row`, `.role-pill`, `.bottom-nav`, …) silently fell back to the dark hex on a light page. Fixed via a `:root` block plus `html.theme-light` re-definition; one source of truth, both themes paint right.
- **Brand status colours darkened in light theme** to clear WCAG AA on white surfaces — `tg-blue` `#2AABEE` → `#0E78C2` (2.84:1 → 4.93:1), `tg-green` → `#008A6E`, `tg-red` → `#B91C1C`, `tg-orange` → `#B8860B`. Affects primary buttons, FAB, settings-chip active, nav-badge, links, status pills, role pills, engine pill states.
- **`:focus-visible` keyboard ring restored** — global `button:focus, input:focus, …{ outline: none }` was eclipsing it, leaving every form element + button with no visible keyboard focus. Suppression now scoped to `:not(:focus-visible)` so mouse-clicks lose the ring but keyboards keep it.
- **Sidebar `.nav-item.active` actually renders.** App was toggling `.active` in JS but no CSS rule existed, so the active page was invisible in the sidebar. Now shows a 3 px blue accent bar + tinted background.
- **Engine pill pulse halo** uses higher alpha + theme-correct green in light mode (was `rgba(79,174,78,0.20)` — invisible on a near-white header).
- **Disabled buttons** (`.tg-btn:disabled`, `.tg-btn-secondary:disabled`) now visibly distinct: `opacity: 0.5 + saturate(0.55) + cursor: not-allowed`.
- **Selection-bar Select-all / Clear** gained an underline-on-hover affordance — the buttons read as buttons, not body copy.

### Fixed — Missing light-theme overrides
- Yellow alert family (`text-yellow-400`, `bg-yellow-500/10`, `border-yellow-500/20`).
- Red alpha variants `bg-red-500/{5,15,25,30}`, `bg-red-600`, `hover:bg-red-700`, `border-red-400/60`, `hover:text-red-400`.
- Brand-blue alphas beyond `/10`+`/20`: `bg-tg-blue/{15,25}`, `border-tg-blue/30`, `hover:bg-tg-blue/{20,25}`, `hover:bg-tg-{green,orange}/20`, `border-tg-{green,orange}/30`.
- `.tab-item` (Viewer + Settings tab strips), `.skeleton` shimmer (was a navy stripe on white), `.media-item .select-badge` (was white-on-white), `.unread-pill.muted`, `.bg-gray-500` status dots, `.hover:bg-white/10` patches inside themed surfaces.
- Status pills in chat rows recoloured per theme: green/orange/grey hard-coded for dark were illegible on light surfaces.

### Added
- `.tg-input::placeholder` colour rule covers BOTH themes — dark previously fell back to a UA default that was barely legible on the panel bg.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v43'` → `'v44'`.

## [2.3.43] — 2026-05-02

### Added — Sidebar groups: collapse + filter
- "Downloaded Groups" header is now a button — tap to collapse/expand the list. State persists in `localStorage` (`tgdl.sidebar.groups.collapsed`).
- New filter input below the header, sticky at the top of the sidebar scroll area so it stays reachable on long lists. DOM-only filter (`filterSidebarGroups`) — no re-render, doesn't fight the existing `_lastHtml` cache, and survives WS-driven re-renders via `_reapplySidebarFilter`.
- Footer stats compacted into one row (Disk + Files share a line with leading icons), giving the list more vertical real estate.

### Fixed — Video thumbnails on stripped ffmpeg builds
- `_generateVideoThumb` now picks its codec path at boot via `_ffmpegHasLibwebp()` (cached). When libwebp is present (default Docker image) it stays on the fast single-pass `-c:v libwebp` flow. When missing (stripped Alpine/musl ffmpeg, Windows static builds) it falls back to a JPEG → sharp WebP pipeline so video thumbs still generate. The retry-at-1s-then-0s pattern is preserved on both paths; tmp JPEG is always cleaned up.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v42'` → `'v43'`.

## [2.3.42] — 2026-05-02

### Fixed — Settings chip-nav: no-reload section routing
- Tapping a chip from inside the Settings page no longer re-runs `loadSettings()` + `initEngine()`. The `/settings/:section` route now bypasses the full `renderPage()` when `state.currentPage === 'settings'` and just smooth-scrolls to the target wrapper. Removes the visible flicker / "reload feel" introduced in v2.3.40 and stops the IntersectionObserver from landing on the wrong card mid-rebuild.
- Deep-link resolution now prefers `#settings-<anchor>` (unique by construction on the chip-nav wrappers) over `[data-settings-section]` (legacy attribute that also lived on inner cards).
- Active chip is set immediately on click — no waiting for the IntersectionObserver to catch up after smooth-scroll completes.
- Removed a duplicate `data-settings-section="appearance"` attribute from the Appearance card; the section wrapper is now the single source of truth for that anchor.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v41'` → `'v42'`.

## [2.3.41] — 2026-05-02

### Added
- **Forwarder destination resolution: 3-stage fallback.** `getInputEntity` → `getEntity` (dialog-cache rescan) → hand-rolled `Api.InputPeerChannel` / `InputPeerChat` from the canonical `-100…` layout. The last-resort branch logs a yellow warning so operators can spot it, and recommends opening the channel once on the configured account if sends still fail.
- **`destination: 'saved'`** now aliases `'me'` (Saved Messages), matching common Telegram-bot phrasing.
- **TG message-id in forward log** — successful auto-forward writes `(msg #<id>)` after the destination so the destination copy is traceable from the dashboard.
- **Backfill quick presets**: "Last 5" and "Last 10" added to the per-chat history modal alongside the existing 100 / 1k / 10k / All buttons. Grid is now `grid-cols-3 sm:grid-cols-6` so the row stays one-line on tablet+.
- **Groups: "Unmonitored" tab** — third tab next to "All" / "Monitored Only", filters dialogs to chats not in the monitored set (`!d.inConfig && !d.enabled`).
- **Viewer "Select all" button** in the floating selection bar — exposes the existing `Ctrl/⌘+A` shortcut as a tap target so mobile users get the same affordance. Single source of truth: shortcut + button both call `selectAllVisible()` from `gallery-select.js`.
- **`TGDL_PORT` env override** — `docker-compose.yml` now uses `${TGDL_PORT:-3000}:3000` so a port collision on the host doesn't require a `docker-compose.yml` edit. Documented in `.env.example`.

### Refactor
- `switchGroupsTab` collapsed from a per-button toggle ladder to a `tabs.forEach` loop — adding a future tab is now a one-line array push.
- `_autoEnableSelectMode` lifted from `setupGallerySelect`'s closure to module scope so the new exported `selectAllVisible()` can reuse it.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v40'` → `'v41'`.

## [2.3.40] — 2026-05-02

### Changed — Mobile UI polish + Settings restructure
- Bottom-nav 6 → 5 tabs. Engine tab replaced by a header `engine-status-pill` (taps to `#/settings/engine`; running/error/reconnecting via animated dot; queue+active badge preserved).
- Settings page reorganised from a flat 15-card stack into 5 sticky-chip-nav sections: System / Accounts / Downloads / Look & Feel / Privacy & Net. Active chip mirrors the section in view via IntersectionObserver. `#/settings/<section>` deep-links unchanged.
- Per-page accent — `#content-header` now carries a 2 px underline that swaps per top-level page (Library blue / Chats green / Backfill orange / Queue cyan / Settings blue), driven by `body[data-page]`.

### Responsive + a11y
- Sidebar clamps to `min(85vw, 18rem)` so a 320 px phone always leaves a tap-out gap.
- Engine status grid `grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-4` (single row on tablet+, 2×2 on phone).
- View-mode menu clamps to viewport (`max-width: min(240px, calc(100vw - 24px))`).
- Header gains `pt-safe` + `@supports` height bump for notched displays.
- Bottom-nav badge offset `right: calc(50% - 1ch)` — tracks the icon regardless of font-size tier.
- Chip-nav is `role="tablist"`, sections are `role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby`. Engine pill `aria-label` reflects state via `header.engine_state`.

### Performance
- `.media-item` gains `aspect-ratio: 1 / 1`, `content-visibility: auto`, `contain-intrinsic-size: auto 200px`, panel-coloured skeleton — kills load-time layout shift and skips offscreen tiles natively.
- Image fade trimmed `0.3s → 0.18s`. Sheet transition `220ms → 180ms`; `will-change: transform` only while open.

### i18n
- 7 new keys in en.json + th.json: `settings.section.{system,accounts,downloads,appearance,network}`, `header.engine`, `header.engine_state`.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v39'` → `'v40'`.

## [2.3.39] — 2026-04-30

### Fixed — iOS double-tap zoom
- `body { touch-action: manipulation }` disables the double-tap-to-zoom gesture across the whole app. The HTML viewport's `user-scalable=no` is intentionally ignored on iOS 10+, so `touch-action` is the only reliable way to silence it. Pinch-zoom is preserved; per-element overrides (`#image-container`, `.lasso-active`) keep their custom touch handling.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v38'` → `'v39'`.

## [2.3.38] — 2026-04-30

### Added — Gallery picker: mobile gestures
- **Touch long-press** → enter select-mode + toggle (with `navigator.vibrate(10)` haptic when supported).
- **Drag after long-press** → continue selecting (Android Material pattern). Each tile the finger crosses is added once.
- **Two-finger drag** → lasso (iOS Photos pattern). One-finger drag is reserved for page scroll.
- Pinch-to-zoom cancels the in-progress long-press cleanly so it never trips a select.
- Long-press logic consolidated into `gallery-select.js`; the duplicate handler in `setupGalleryGestures` is gone.

### Docs
- README updated with the new touch gesture matrix.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v37'` → `'v38'`.

## [2.3.37] — 2026-04-30

### Docs
- README, `docs/API.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/DEPLOY.md`, `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` brought current with the v2.3.x feature set: guest role, share-links, dedup, thumbnails, NSFW review tool, auto-update, smart-resume backfill, gallery gestures, view-mode picker.
- New WebSocket event matrix in `docs/API.md`.
- New SPA + backend module index in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- New auto-update + ffmpeg + thumbnail concurrency env vars documented in `docs/DEPLOY.md`.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v36'` → `'v37'`.

## [2.3.36] — 2026-04-30

### Added — Gallery picker: desktop-grade gestures
- **Drag-to-select (lasso)** — rubber-band rectangle selects every overlapping tile.
- **Ctrl / Cmd + click** — toggle one tile, auto-enables select mode.
- **Shift + click** — range-select from the last anchor to here.
- **Ctrl / Cmd + A** — select all visible tiles.
- **Esc** — exit select mode + clear.
- **Delete / Backspace** — bulk-delete the current selection.
- All updates are in-place — toggling `.is-selected` on the matching tile, no full grid re-render. Lasso stays smooth on 1000-tile galleries.
- Long-press on touch (existing) still works.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v35'` → `'v36'`.

## [2.3.35] — 2026-04-30

### Changed — View modes: polished List + dropdown picker
- **List mode** redesigned — proper grid columns (thumb · name+group · size · date · open), hover row highlight, divider between rows, responsive (collapses to thumb+name+open on mobile).
- **Dropdown picker** replaces the cycle button — Grid / Compact / List shown together with active checkmark. No more clicking through to find the mode you want.
- Tile markup unified across modes; switching is pure CSS (instant, no re-render, no scroll drift).

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v34'` → `'v35'`.

## [2.3.34] — 2026-04-30

### Changed — Backfill: smart resume + auto-spawn
- **Smart resume** — `iterMessages` now uses `maxId: minMessageId - 1` (or `minId: maxMessageId + 1` for catch-up) instead of walking every message from newest. Resuming a partially-completed backfill is ~80-90% faster.
- **Per-group lock** — second click on Backfill while one is running returns 409 with `code: 'ALREADY_RUNNING'` instead of spawning a duplicate iterator.
- **Auto-backfill on first add** — enabling a brand-new group with zero rows in `downloads` triggers a background backfill of the last N messages (default 100, configurable, 0 = disabled).
- **Auto catch-up after restart** — monitor's boot-time top-message check now spawns a `catch-up` backfill if the gap to the last stored row exceeds the configured threshold.
- **3 new history modes** surfaced in WS payloads + UI: `pull-older` / `catch-up` / `rescan`.

### Added — Auto-NSFW on download (if enabled)
- Every successful download fires `pregenerateNsfw(id)` alongside `pregenerateThumb(id)` — newly-arrived photos get classified in the background, no need to wait for the next batch scan. No-op when `advanced.nsfw.enabled` is false.

### Config (no hardcode)
- New `advanced.history.{ autoFirstBackfill, autoFirstLimit, autoCatchUp, autoCatchUpThreshold, batchInsertSize, batchInsertMaxAgeMs }`. All clamped server-side; defaults preserve current behavior.
- New Settings → Advanced rows for the auto-backfill knobs.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v33'` → `'v34'`.

## [2.3.33] — 2026-04-30

### Added — NSFW review tool (Phase 1: photos)
- Maintenance → "Scan images for NSFW (18+)" — classifies every photo locally via `@huggingface/transformers` (WASM, runs on Win / macOS / glibc-Linux / Alpine / ARM identically).
- Surfaces photos the classifier scored as **NOT 18+** (deletion candidates for a curated 18+ library) in a paginated review sheet — tick + bulk delete with confirm.
- Per-row "Mark as 18+" whitelists genuine 18+ false-negatives so future scans skip them.
- Background scan with WS progress + browser notification on completion. Cancel any time.
- Opt-in via Settings → Advanced → NSFW review tool. Threshold + concurrency + model id all config-driven (no hardcoded values). Model downloads once to `data/models/`.
- Config namespace: `advanced.nsfw.{ enabled, model, threshold, concurrency, batchSize, fileTypes, cacheDir }`.
- DB columns added (idempotent migration): `nsfw_score`, `nsfw_checked_at`, `nsfw_whitelist`. Indexes for unscanned-row scan and review-sort queries.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v32'` → `'v33'`.

## [2.3.32] — 2026-04-30

### Changed — Media gallery: smooth on big libraries
- Infinite-scroll page-2+ loads now append only the new tiles (`insertAdjacentHTML`) instead of re-rendering the whole grid. O(N_new) per scroll page, not O(N_total).
- WS `file_deleted` removes the single matching tile from the DOM in place — no full re-render.
- Click handling switched to event delegation; per-tile listeners gone.
- Search uses AbortController + sequence tag — fast typing cancels in-flight requests, no out-of-order race. Debounce 250 ms → 200 ms.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v31'` → `'v32'`.

## [2.3.31] — 2026-04-30

### Changed — Queue page: gradual load + in-place progress patches
- Append-only rendering: 50 rows on first paint, 50 more appended via IntersectionObserver as you scroll.
- Live progress events patch the matching row in place — no full re-render per WS tick.
- Search input debounced 120 ms; filter / sort / search reset scroll to top.
- Replaces the prior absolute-positioning virtualiser; smoother on large queues.

### Removed — Live downloads list from the Engine card
- The per-row live list duplicated the Queue page; replaced with a "View full queue" link.
- Engine card now focuses on monitor lifecycle + headline counters.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v30'` → `'v31'`.

## [2.3.30] — 2026-04-30

### Added — One-click in-dashboard auto-update (Docker)

A new **Install update** button in Settings → Maintenance (and on the status-bar update pill) pulls the latest container image and recreates the running container in place — same effect as `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d` but triggered from the UI. The data volume, config, and Telegram sessions are preserved verbatim; the SQLite database is snapshotted to `data/backups/` before the swap.

#### Security model — dashboard never touches `/var/run/docker.sock`

The web process intentionally does not get the Docker socket. Instead, the swap is performed by an opt-in `containrrr/watchtower:1.7.1` sidecar that:

- Has a **read-only** mount of `/var/run/docker.sock`.
- Runs with `WATCHTOWER_LABEL_ENABLE=true`, scoping operations to ONLY the container carrying the `com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable=true` label (added to `telegram-downloader` in `docker-compose.yml`). Even if compromised, watchtower cannot touch unrelated apps on the same host.
- Exposes its HTTP API behind a bearer token (`WATCHTOWER_HTTP_API_TOKEN`) that lives in `.env` and never enters `config.json`.

A hypothetical RCE in the dashboard cannot escalate to host root because the dashboard never sees the socket — it can only POST to watchtower's `/v1/update`, which is bounded to "pull and recreate the labeled container".

#### Data preservation

- The downloads volume (`./data:/app/data`) is bind-mounted; container recreation never touches it.
- `data/config.json`, `data/web-sessions.json`, `data/sessions/*.enc`, and `data/db.sqlite` all live under that mount.
- Before triggering watchtower the server runs `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` and copies the DB to `data/backups/db-pre-update-<utc-stamp>.sqlite` (most-recent 5 snapshots kept).
- Schema migrations (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN`) in `core/db.js` are idempotent and forward-compatible — older databases are upgraded transparently on first boot of the new image.

#### Setup (opt-in)

Existing installs continue to work unchanged. To enable the button:

1. Generate a token: `openssl rand -hex 32`.
2. Put it in `.env` next to `docker-compose.yml`:

   ```
   WATCHTOWER_HTTP_API_TOKEN=<hex>
   ```

3. Boot with the new profile:

   ```
   docker compose --profile auto-update up -d
   ```

Without the token (or without the profile) the dashboard renders an explanatory tooltip and falls back to linking the GitHub release page.

#### UI

- **Status-bar update pill** — clicking it now opens a chooser sheet with two actions: **Install vX.Y.Z** (one-click swap) and **View release notes** (GitHub).
- **Settings → Maintenance → Install update** — same chooser, plus a status line showing whether auto-update is ready, requires the profile, or is in standalone mode.
- **Full-screen "Updating…" overlay** appears the moment the swap is initiated, so the operator knows the imminent disconnect is intentional.
- **Auto-reconnect + auto-reload** — the SPA's existing WS reconnect logic re-establishes the connection once the new container's healthcheck passes; a version-change check then reloads the page so the new SPA bundle is live.

#### New endpoints

- `GET /api/update/status` — capability probe (`{ available, inDocker, watchtowerConfigured }`). Drives the disabled/help states in the UI.
- `POST /api/update` (admin-only) — snapshots the DB, calls watchtower, broadcasts `update_started` over WS, returns 200 with the snapshot path. Returns 503 with `code: 'AUTO_UPDATE_UNAVAILABLE'` and an actionable message when the sidecar isn't reachable.

#### Files

- `src/core/updater.js` — capability probe + DB snapshot + watchtower client.
- `docker-compose.yml` — opt-in `watchtower` service under the `auto-update` profile, with the label allowlist + HTTP API enabled.
- `.env.example` — new file documenting `WATCHTOWER_HTTP_API_TOKEN` (gitignored via existing `.env*` rule).

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v29'` → `'v30'`.

## [2.3.29] — 2026-04-30

### Added — Server-side WebP thumbnails for the gallery

The gallery used to load full-size source files into every grid tile (or skip the preview entirely on mobile video). It now serves compact, server-generated WebP thumbnails — far smaller transfers, no decoder pressure on the client, and previews work consistently across image, video, and audio-with-cover-art on every viewport.

- **`src/core/thumbs.js`** — single helper exposing `getOrCreateThumb(id, w)`.
  - Image source → sharp resize → WebP (quality 70, effort 6). Honors EXIF orientation.
  - Video source → ffmpeg seeks 1 s in, scales + encodes to WebP in a **single pass** (no intermediate JPEG → sharp transcode), reading nothing past the first keyframe. ~10× faster than grab-then-resize.
  - Audio source → extracts the embedded cover-art (`attached_pic` stream) when present.
  - Cache lives at `data/thumbs/<sha-of-id+w>.webp`. Atomic publish via `.tmp → final` rename — a crash mid-write never produces a poisoned cache hit.
- **`GET /api/thumbs/:id?w=240`** (auth-gated, allowed for guest sessions) — cache-first, sends `Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400, immutable` + `Last-Modified` so the browser HTTP cache absorbs subsequent grid scrolls. Width snaps to `[120, 200, 240, 320, 480]` so a hostile caller can't fork a generation per pixel.
- **Concurrency**: image jobs run 8 in parallel (sharp is libvips C, RAM-bound); video jobs run 3 in parallel (ffmpeg pins a CPU core). Both env-overridable. In-flight de-duplication collapses 50 simultaneous requests for the same `(id, w)` into a single generation, so a fast scroll never spawns a job storm.
- **Auto-generation on download** — `pregenerateThumb(id)` fires from `registerDownload` after every successful insert (background, non-blocking, queues behind the same per-kind semaphores). The first gallery scroll already finds the WebP in cache.
- **Cache invalidation** — single-file delete, bulk-delete, and dedup-delete all call `purgeThumbsForDownload(id)` so a stale thumb never keeps serving bytes after the source file is gone.
- **Maintenance UI**:
  - **Build thumbnails for older files** — sweeps every download row that lacks a default-width thumb and queues generation. Honours the per-kind concurrency caps; broadcasts `thumbs_progress` over WS for a determinate progress bar. Single in-flight guard.
  - **Wipe cache** (refresh icon next to Build) — drops every cached WebP. Useful after a quality tweak or corruption scare; on-demand generation refills the cache on the next scroll.
  - Cache stat line ("N cached, X MB · ffmpeg unavailable — image-only" when applicable) sits under the row.

### Cross-platform install — no setup required

Out-of-the-box on every supported platform:

- **Standalone Win / macOS / glibc-Linux** — `npm install` pulls `sharp` (musl + glibc prebuilts) plus the optional `@ffmpeg-installer/ffmpeg` (bundles a static binary per platform). Zero manual setup.
- **Docker (alpine/musl)** — Dockerfile now `apk add --no-cache ffmpeg` so the system binary is on PATH. The npm `@ffmpeg-installer/ffmpeg` is moved to `optionalDependencies` so its glibc-only postinstall never fails the alpine `npm ci`.
- **Resolver order** — `process.env.FFMPEG_PATH` → `/usr/bin/ffmpeg` → `/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg` → `@ffmpeg-installer/ffmpeg` → bare `ffmpeg`. All exposed via `hasFfmpeg()` so the `/api/maintenance/thumbs/stats` payload tells the UI when video / audio-cover thumbs are unavailable on this host.

### Frontend

- Gallery tiles for images and videos render `<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/api/thumbs/<id>?w=…">`. Mobile and desktop share the same code path — no more "blank black tile" on iOS Safari for video posters.
- Dedup-sheet preview thumbnails switched from `/files/<path>?inline=1` (full file) to `/api/thumbs/<id>?w=120` (~5-15 KB).
- SW bypass for `/api/thumbs/` so the SW cache doesn't balloon for libraries with thousands of tiles; the browser HTTP cache + `immutable` Cache-Control handles repeat fetches efficiently.

### CPU/GPU note

All generation is CPU-side (sharp via libvips, ffmpeg via libwebp). No GPU acceleration — keeps the deployment story zero-config across every host.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v28'` → `'v29'`.

## [2.3.28] — 2026-04-30

### Changed — Share-link limits and history retention are now config-driven
Removed the hardcoded TTL bounds, rate-limit thresholds, and history retention window introduced in earlier 2.3.x releases. Operators can now tune these via `config.advanced` without recompiling.

- **`advanced.share`** (new namespace) — `ttlMinSec`, `ttlMaxSec`, `ttlDefaultSec`, `rateLimitWindowMs`, `rateLimitMax`. Defaults preserve the previous behavior (60s / 90d / 7d / 60s / 60). Each field is clamped on save and applied immediately on `config_updated` (no restart). The share-link rate-limit middleware reads the current values per-request via function-form `windowMs` / `limit`.
- **`advanced.history.retentionDays`** (new) — was hardcoded to 30; now configurable, range 1-3650. Resolved at every read of the on-disk job list so a save takes effect on the next prune.
- `share.js` exports `applyShareLimits()` and `getShareLimits()`; the original `TTL_*_SEC` constants stay exported as `*_DEFAULT` aliases for callers (and the test suite) that want the spec values.

### Tests
6 new tests covering `applyShareLimits` / `getShareLimits` (default revert, range clamping, inverted-bounds rejection, 10-year ceiling cap, NEVER sentinel preserved). Full suite: 99 / 99 passing.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v27'` → `'v28'`.

## [2.3.27] — 2026-04-30

### Added — Token-based shareable media links
Admins can mint signed share-URLs that let a non-user (e.g. a friend) stream or download a single media file without logging into the dashboard.

- **HMAC-SHA256 signed URLs** — `/share/<linkId>?exp=<epoch>&sig=<43-char-base64url>`. The sig binds `linkId|exp` so flipping either invalidates it. Verified with `crypto.timingSafeEqual` (length-checked first to avoid early-return timing leaks).
- **Per-server secret** in `config.web.shareSecret` — 32 random bytes, lazy-generated on first boot, persisted via the existing atomic config writer. Rotating it invalidates every outstanding link.
- **`share_links` table** is the source of truth for revocation + audit (`access_count`, `last_accessed_at`, optional `label`). FK `ON DELETE CASCADE` on `download_id` so deleting/purging a file kills every outstanding link automatically. `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` set per-connection for the cascade to fire.
- **Public `GET /share/:linkId`** — registered BEFORE `checkAuth` and added to `PUBLIC_PATH_PREFIXES`. Three independent gates: rate limiter (60/min/IP), HMAC verify, then DB row check (revoked/expired). All failure modes return 401 with a body code (`bad_sig` / `revoked` / `expired`) so an external scanner can't enumerate which links exist. Hands off to `safeResolveDownload` + `res.sendFile` so **Range requests work** end-to-end (videos can be scrubbed). `Cache-Control: no-store` + `X-Frame-Options: DENY` + `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`.
- **Admin API `/api/share/links*`** (admin-only via the chokepoint added in v2.3.26):
  - `POST /api/share/links` — body `{ downloadId, ttlSeconds?, label? }` → returns `{ url, expiresAt, id }`. TTL clamped to `[60s, 90 days]`. **`ttlSeconds: 0` = "never expires"** — sentinel honored end-to-end (DB stores `expires_at = 0`, verifier skips the time gate, frontend renders "Never expires").
  - `GET /api/share/links?downloadId=…` — list links for one file (Share sheet) or all (Maintenance sheet).
  - `DELETE /api/share/links/:id` — revoke. Idempotent.
- **UI: Share button in viewer modal** (next to Delete/Download, marked `data-admin-only`). Opens a sheet with TTL radio (1h / 24h / 7d / 30d / 90d / Never), optional label, "Create share link" button (auto-copies on success), and a list of existing links with per-row Copy / Revoke + access counter.
- **UI: Maintenance → Active share links** sheet — search across filename / group / label, "Active only" toggle, per-row Copy / Revoke. Single source of truth for the admin's outstanding link inventory.
- **Service Worker bypass** for `/share/*` — never cache, so a revoked link can't keep serving from the SW.

### Added — Download-time deduplication (no-duplicate writes)
The downloader now hashes every file the moment it lands on disk and folds duplicates into the existing copy.

- **`src/core/checksum.js`** — single canonical `sha256OfFile(absPath)` helper. Every code path that hashes media (the post-write check in `downloader.js`, the on-demand catch-up scan in `dedup.js`, any future verification flow) imports this one function. Same algorithm (SHA-256), same encoding (lowercase hex, 64 chars), same streaming read strategy. `dedup.js`'s previous local `hashFile` is now a thin alias.
- **Downloader** computes the SHA-256 right after the atomic `.part → final` rename, then queries the DB for an existing row with the same `file_hash` AND `file_size`. If one exists AND its file is still present on disk:
  - The new copy is `unlink`ed.
  - The new DB row is inserted with `file_path` pointing at the existing file (so the gallery shows the file in this group too without storing duplicate bytes).
  - `incrementDiskUsage(0)` — disk-rotator quota stays accurate.
  - `download_complete` event carries `deduped: true` for monitor logs.
- Hash failures (rare — race with sweepers) fall through and store the row normally; the existing on-demand `dedup` scan picks them up later.

### Tests
21 new tests in `tests/share.test.js`: secret bootstrap (generation / regeneration / fingerprint), sign / verify round-trip with tamper rejection (linkId, exp, sig), base64url shape, secret-rotation invalidates, TTL clamp (defaults / floor / ceiling / NEVER sentinel / null vs 0 distinction), URL builder, sig-masking helper. Full suite: 93 / 93 passing.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v26'` → `'v27'`.

## [2.3.26] — 2026-04-30

### Added — Guest role (read-only viewer alongside admin)
The dashboard now supports an opt-in **read-only "guest" role** alongside the admin password. Guests can browse media and watch videos but cannot delete files, change settings, or manage Telegram accounts. Their video player preferences (autoplay/volume/etc.) save to localStorage and are independent from admin's.

- **`config.web.guestPasswordHash` + `config.web.guestEnabled`** — new optional config keys. If unset the dashboard behaves exactly as before.
- **Sessions carry a role** — `data/web-sessions.json` records now include `role: 'admin' | 'guest'`. Legacy sessions (no role field) default to admin; no forced re-login on upgrade.
- **Default-deny `/api` chokepoint for guests** — a single middleware after `checkAuth` consults an explicit allowlist (`GET /api/downloads*`, `GET /api/stats`, `GET /api/groups` (read), `GET /api/queue/snapshot`, `GET /api/monitor/status`, `GET /api/history*`, `POST /api/logout`). Anything not on the list returns `403 {adminRequired:true}`. New mutation routes are admin-gated for free.
- **`POST /api/auth/guest-password`** (admin-only) — set/enable/disable/clear the guest password from Settings → Dashboard Security. Rejects equality with the admin password (would render the guest role unreachable). Disabling or clearing the password also revokes every active guest session immediately.
- **SPA: `body[data-role]` CSS gate.** Every admin-only DOM node carries `data-admin-only`; a single CSS rule hides them when `state.role === 'guest'`. Sidebar nav (Backfill/Stories/Account add), Settings sections (everything except Video Player + Appearance), gallery delete buttons, queue mutation buttons — all gone for guests in one pass.
- **SPA router** redirects guest sessions away from `#/groups`, `#/backfill`, `#/queue`, `#/engine`, `#/stories`, `#/account/add`, and any `#/settings/<section>` other than `video-player` / `appearance` to `#/viewer`.
- **Header role pill** ("Guest") so the user always knows which role is active.
- **`api.js` 403 interceptor** toasts `errors.admin_only` for the rare race where a stale guest tab fires an admin call.

### Added — Recent backfills: per-row delete + Clear all
The Recent backfills list (last 30 days) was display-only; long lists could not be tidied up.

- **`DELETE /api/history/:jobId`** — drops one finished entry from the in-memory map + on-disk `history-jobs.json`. Refuses to delete a running job (cancel first).
- **`DELETE /api/history`** — clear every finished entry in one call. Running jobs are preserved.
- **Per-row × button** + **Clear all** on Backfill → Recent. Cross-tab via WS `history_deleted` / `history_cleared` so other open tabs drop the row in real time.

### Added — Checksum-based duplicate finder (Maintenance)
The `downloads.file_hash` column has been in the schema since v2 but was never populated. Maintenance now exposes a one-shot scan that hashes every file, groups byte-identical copies, and lets the admin pick which to keep.

- **New `src/core/dedup.js`** — `findDuplicates()` walks every row missing `file_hash`, streams SHA-256 over the file, writes the digest back, then GROUPs BY hash for sets where COUNT > 1. First scan is O(bytes-on-disk); subsequent scans are nearly free.
- **`POST /api/maintenance/dedup/scan`** — runs the catch-up + grouping. Broadcasts `dedup_progress` over WS for a determinate progress bar. Single in-flight guard: a second concurrent scan returns 409.
- **`POST /api/maintenance/dedup/delete`** — body `{ ids: [...] }`. Deletes the selected files from disk AND drops their DB rows in one transactional sweep. Reports `{ removed, freedBytes, missingFiles }`.
- **Maintenance UI** — new **Find duplicate files** button. Scans, then opens a sheet with every duplicate set: thumbnails, filenames, group, date, file URL preview link. Default selection deletes all but the **oldest** copy in each set; per-set **Keep oldest / Keep newest** shortcuts; per-row checkbox flips. Bottom of the sheet shows live "N selected · X MB will be freed" totals + an explicit destructive confirm before deletion.

### Changed — Mobile gallery: smooth + working video previews

- **`FILES_PER_PAGE` is now viewport-aware** — desktop stays at 100; mobile (`max-width: 768px`) drops to 50, matching the lower tile-per-row count so DOM size scales with screen size.
- **Mobile video tiles use a poster-only render** — `<video preload="none">` is unreliable on mobile Safari (often paints a blank black tile) and high-memory across a 50-tile grid even when it works. Mobile now renders an icon + play badge inside a subtle gradient instead. Tap still opens the full viewer with the real `<video>`. Desktop keeps the existing lazy `<video>` for hover scrub.
- `<img>` tiles gained `loading="lazy"` to avoid an iOS over-eager prefetch when the user scrolls fast.

### Tests
- 8 new tests in `tests/web-auth.test.js` covering the role-aware `loginVerify`, `isGuestEnabled`, `issueSession({ role })`, and `revokeAllGuestSessions`.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v25'` → `'v26'`.

## [2.3.25] — 2026-04-28

### Changed — backpressure abort window 5 min → 15 min
The history-backfill backpressure was aborting jobs whose pending queue sat just barely above the cap (e.g. 513 vs 500), even when the downloader was healthy.

Why it fired: a single bad-luck job that hits FloodWait every retry can stall for `MAX_FLOOD_RETRIES × delay` = 8 × 60 s = **8 min** before the downloader gives up and emits an `error` event. The backfill abort at 5 min therefore guaranteed a kill in this scenario, even though the downloader was healthy and would have recovered.

- **Default `backpressureMaxWaitMs`** bumped 5 min → **15 min** in both `history.js` (inline fallback) + `settings.js` (Advanced default) + `server.js` (config validator default). Existing user configs that have an explicit value keep theirs unchanged.
- **New `stalled` event** emitted by the history runner at the half-way mark (7.5 min by default). Carries `{ pending, cap, stallSeconds }`. The runtime forwards it for the SPA to render a "stalled, still trying…" hint without dropping the job.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v24'` → `'v25'`.

## [2.3.24] — 2026-04-28

### Changed — gallery feels smooth
- **Pre-fetch the next page from 1200 px away.** The IntersectionObserver on `#load-more-sentinel` now uses `rootMargin: '1200px 0px 1200px 0px'`, so the next batch is requested while the user is still ~1200 px from the bottom of the current one. Combined with the bigger page size below, the visible scroll-stutter on a long gallery should be gone.
- **`FILES_PER_PAGE: 50 → 100`.** Half the round trips for the same scroll distance.

### Changed — `/api/monitor/status` and `/api/stats` now WS-push
The 30 s + 60 s safety polls in `monitor-status.js` and `statusbar.js` are replaced with WebSocket broadcasts:

- **Server**: `_pushMonitorStatus()` broadcasts `monitor_status_push` every 3 s with the full `/api/monitor/status` snapshot. `_pushStats()` broadcasts `stats_push` every 30 s with the full `/api/stats` payload. Both skip the build entirely when no WebSocket clients are connected, and coalesce overlapping async builds via an in-flight flag. The single GET endpoints stay on for the SPA's first paint + a manual refresh.
- **SPA `monitor-status.js`**: dropped the 30 s `setInterval`, the visibilitychange-driven catch-up, and the timer machinery. One HTTP fetch on the first subscriber so the bar isn't blank for 3 s, then rides the WS push for the rest of the session. Re-fetches once on every WS reconnect (`__ws_open`) to fill the gap a disconnect window left.
- **SPA `statusbar.js`**: dropped the 60 s stats poll. Listens for `stats_push` and applies the payload directly. Mutation events (`download_complete` / `file_deleted` / `bulk_delete` / `purge_all` / `group_purged`) still trigger an immediate refetch so the user sees their own delete / new download instantly, ahead of the next 30-second push.

Net effect: on an idle dashboard with WS connected, server-side load + client-side wakeups for these two endpoints drop from ~3 calls/min to **0**.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v23'` → `'v24'`.

## [2.3.23] — 2026-04-28

### Fixed — hotfix for v2.3.22 regression
- **Infinite recursion → "Maximum call stack size exceeded"** the moment the user clicked any sidebar nav. v2.3.22 added `navigateTo('viewer')` inside `showAllMedia()` to fix the "click does nothing on Settings page" bug. But `renderPage('viewer')` was *already* the caller of `showAllMedia()`, so the chain became: sidebar click → `showAllMedia` → `navigateTo` → `renderPage('viewer')` → `showAllMedia` → `navigateTo` → … → stack overflow → crash loop in the SPA. Guarded the navigation with `if (state.currentPage !== 'viewer') { navigateTo('viewer'); return; }` so renderPage re-enters the function exactly once with the page already visible, and never fires the loop.

### Changed
- **SW VERSION** bumped `'v22'` → `'v23'`.

## [2.3.22] — 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **Clicking "All Media" did nothing visible** when the user was on Settings / Engine / Queue / Backfill. `showAllMedia()` reset state and started the fetch but never called `navigateTo('viewer')`, so the response loaded into a hidden DOM and the user saw no change. `openGroup()` already navigates correctly; brought `showAllMedia()` in line.
- **Header avatar lingered on the previous group's photo** after switching to All Media. `updateHeaderAvatar()` now treats `groupId == null` as "non-group view" and renders a generic gallery glyph instead of leaving the previous chat's avatar floating in the header. `showAllMedia()` calls `updateHeaderAvatar(null, null)` so the swap happens the moment you click.

### Changed
- **SW VERSION** bumped `'v21'` → `'v22'`.

## [2.3.21] — 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **Queue page extremely laggy + 404 spam in console.** Two related causes:
  - Video rows rendered `<video preload="metadata" src="/files/…">` for every visible done item; Chromium pulls ~256 KB of MP4 header per row on every render, re-fired on every scroll → smoking-hot CPU + network and the "queue โครตหน่วง" report.
  - Image rows rendered `<img src="/files/…">` even for files that had been rotated / deleted / never fully written → 404 console spam.
  - **Fix**: dropped the per-row thumbnails entirely. Each row now shows a tinted icon placeholder coloured by media type (blue for image, white-on-black for video, orange for audio, grey for everything else). Click-to-view still opens the actual file in the in-app viewer when the row is `done`. Zero network round-trips, zero 404 risk.

### Added
- **Max Download Speed: free-form input.** The hard-coded 5-option dropdown (Unlimited / 1 / 5 / 10 / 20 MB/s) is now a numeric input + KB/s / MB/s / GB/s unit picker. Empty value = unlimited; any number resolves to bytes on save. The label above the input mirrors the current value live.

### Changed
- **Default Volume slider** — step `5` → `1` for fine control, label + value live on one balanced row above the bar (was label-above + value-below). Picks up the branded `.tg-range` thumb so it matches the player's volume slider.

### SW
- VERSION bumped `'v20'` → `'v21'`.

## [2.3.20] — 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **Status-bar disk usage was still nonsense after v2.3.19** ("Disk: 1.03 MB" with 8 786 files) because the DB rows themselves carried `file_size = 0 / NULL` from older downloader versions that didn't always stat after rename. The integrity sweep now **backfills the correct on-disk size** every time it walks a row whose stored `file_size` doesn't match the actual `fs.stat().size`. Result: after one boot-sweep pass (≈30 s after start, then every `intervalMin` minutes), the status-bar disk number reflects reality. The sweep also now tolerates the legacy `data/downloads/` prefix in `file_path` (same fix v2.3.19 applied to `safeResolveDownload()`), so rows that were previously skipped as "outside downloads dir" will now stat + heal cleanly.
- **Manual `Verify files on disk`** in Settings → Maintenance now reports `sizeFixed` alongside `pruned`, so you can see how many DB rows had their byte-count repaired.

### Changed
- **SW VERSION** bumped `'v19'` → `'v20'`.

## [2.3.19] — 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **Queue thumbnail / "click to view" 404'd for every finished item.** Root cause: `downloader.js`'s `buildPath()` defaults to `'./data/downloads'` (relative), so `writtenPath` (and the `complete` event payload's `filePath`) is a relative string like `data/downloads/<group>/images/<file>`. v2.3.6's stripper only handled the absolute form (`/app/data/downloads/<…>`); when the input was relative-with-prefix it slipped through unchanged → SPA built `/files/data/downloads/<…>` → `safeResolveDownload()` joined to `DOWNLOADS_DIR` a second time → 404. Two-part fix:
  - `pushQueueHistory()` now walks **three** forms (absolute under `DOWNLOADS_DIR` / relative `./data/downloads/` / relative `data/downloads/`) and strips whichever it sees, so new entries persist the canonical `<group>/<type>/<file>` form.
  - `safeResolveDownload()` is now **lenient on the legacy prefix** — it strips any leading `data/downloads/` (and `data\downloads\` on Windows) before joining to `DOWNLOADS_DIR`, so existing queue-history entries + DB rows from before this release also resolve correctly.
- **All Media: some tiles 404 / "click open viewer" failed for some files.** Same root cause — DB rows from before the path-stripping fix carried the legacy prefix. The `safeResolveDownload()` change above fixes those too without a DB rewrite.
- **Status-bar disk usage showed nonsensical values** (e.g. `930.54 KB` with 8 784 files). The endpoint was reading from `data/disk_usage.json` — a cache that older downloader versions wrote sparingly and never invalidated when the DB was purged + repopulated. Switched to the live `SUM(file_size)` from the DB (`getDbStats().totalSize`); falls back to the JSON cache only when the DB sum is zero.

### Changed
- **SW VERSION** bumped `'v18'` → `'v19'`.

## [2.3.18] — 2026-04-28

### Added — `?v=` cache-busting on JS / locale assets
- **HTML rewrite**: `<script src="/js/...">`, `<link href="/locales/...">`, etc., are post-processed before the SPA HTML is served, appending `?v=<APP_VERSION>` to every internal `js/` or `locales/` URL.
- **JS rewrite**: every relative `import './X.js'` (and `import('./X.js')`, `import './X.js'`) inside the served JS modules is rewritten to carry the same `?v=` so the child URL inherits the cache-bust and the browser HTTP cache can't stale-serve a single transitive module while the rest of the bundle is fresh.
- **Cache-Control upgrade**: any `/js/*.js` or `/locales/*.json` request that arrives with a `?v=` query string now returns `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`. Bare requests (no `?v=`) keep the conservative 1 h fallback so a curl / direct fetch still revalidates.
- **In-memory rewrite cache** so the regex runs once per file per process lifetime; a server restart re-reads (which is exactly what we want after `docker compose pull`).

The combined effect: a fresh release flips every internal asset URL automatically (no manual filename hashing, no build step), the browser HTTP cache treats it as a different resource, and the SW cache-first path naturally fetches the new bytes too.

### Changed
- **SW VERSION** bumped `'v17'` → `'v18'`.

## [2.3.17] — 2026-04-28

### Removed
- **Help paragraph under the Font picker.** The text was stuck at "All ten options support Thai" since v2.3.14, never updated when v2.3.15 added the 10 Latin-only fonts (and would have grown stale again next time the registry expands). Removed entirely — the picker is self-explanatory because the `<optgroup>` labels already say "Thai-capable", "Latin (Thai falls back)", and "No webfont".
- Dropped i18n keys `settings.font_help` (en + th). 637 → **636 keys total** (parity preserved).

### Changed
- **SW VERSION** bumped `'v16'` → `'v17'`.

## [2.3.16] — 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **Font picker `<select>` was rendering empty** for some users. Root cause: `app.js`'s init wired the picker through `await import('./fonts.js')` (dynamic import). When the service worker had a stale shell cached, the dynamic import either resolved to the wrong module instance or failed silently — either way `populateSelect()` never ran and the dropdown stayed empty (`<!-- Options populated by js/fonts.js… -->` comment visible only to anyone inspecting the DOM).
  - Switched to a **static `import * as Fonts from './fonts.js'`** at the top of `app.js` so the SW handles `fonts.js` like any other shell module.
  - Added a **defensive re-populate inside `loadSettings()`** so opening the Settings page always seeds the dropdown, even if init's first attempt failed. The change-listener gets wired exactly once per session via a module-level `_fontPickerWired` flag.
- **SW VERSION** bumped `'v15'` → `'v16'` so the static-import path actually reaches the browser instead of being served from the v2.3.15 cache.

## [2.3.15] — 2026-04-28

### Added — Latin font choices
- **10 Latin Google Fonts** added to the picker on top of v2.3.14's 10 Thai-capable fonts: **Roboto**, **Inter**, **Open Sans**, **Lato**, **Source Sans 3**, **Manrope**, **DM Sans**, **Work Sans**, **Plus Jakarta Sans**, **Outfit**. Thai characters fall back through the `--tgdl-font-family` chain to IBM Plex Sans Thai so a Latin-only pick (e.g. Roboto) still renders Thai cleanly.
- The `<select>` is now grouped by `<optgroup>`: **Thai-capable** (10), **Latin (Thai falls back)** (10), **No webfont** (1) = **21 total**.

### Fixed
- **Per-group view: media not complete after switching from a Photos / Videos tab.** When the user filtered All Media to Photos and then clicked a group in the sidebar, the previous `state.currentFilter` survived → `loadGroupFiles()` fetched `?type=images` only → user saw a partial library and the tab UI silently said "All". Both `openGroup()` and `showAllMedia()` now reset the filter to "all" and re-paint the tab strip to match.

### Changed
- **SW VERSION** bumped `'v14'` → `'v15'` so the new font registry + filter-reset reach the browser.

## [2.3.14] — 2026-04-28

### Added — user-selectable font
- **Settings → Appearance → Font** — pick from 11 options (10 Google Fonts that support Thai + a no-webfont "System default"). IBM Plex Sans is still the default. Switching applies live across the whole app via a `--tgdl-font-family` CSS variable; mono regions (time block, log viewer, queue size column) stay on IBM Plex Mono regardless of UI choice.
  - **IBM Plex Sans** (default, current pair: IBM Plex Sans + IBM Plex Sans Thai)
  - **Noto Sans Thai** (Google's own pan-script family)
  - **Sarabun** (very common Thai government / SaaS font)
  - **Prompt** (modern Thai display)
  - **Kanit** (popular UI face)
  - **Mitr** (rounded, friendly)
  - **K2D** (geometric, pairs well with Latin)
  - **Bai Jamjuree** (geometric)
  - **Athiti** (humanist sans)
  - **Niramit** (light / airy)
  - **System default** (no webfont — uses the OS's native Thai face; useful for air-gapped deployments)
- **Boot-time font preload** in `index.html` reads the saved choice from `localStorage` BEFORE first paint and injects the matching `<link>` so the SPA opens with the right font already in CSSOM (no flash of unstyled text on cold load).
- New module `js/fonts.js` houses the font registry + `applyFont()` + `populateSelect()`. The boot-time `<script>` mirrors the same registry inline (the script runs before the module graph evaluates).
- **i18n**: `settings.font`, `settings.font_help` (en + th lockstep, 637 keys total).

### Changed
- **SW VERSION** bumped `'v13'` → `'v14'` so the new `index.html` (with boot script + font select) reaches the browser instead of being served from the v2.3.13 cache.

## [2.3.13] — 2026-04-28

### Changed — locale tone + casing pass

- **`th.json` rewritten in formal-but-readable Thai** — the tone a Thai-language SaaS product (Notion Thai, Microsoft Thai) would ship. Removed casual particles, used polite constructions, replaced slangy translations ("เซฟ" → "บันทึก", "หน้าตา" → "รูปลักษณ์", "หลุดจาก server เลย" → "ขาดการเชื่อมต่อกับเซิร์ฟเวอร์"). No trailing periods on Thai sentences (Thai punctuation convention). Tech terms kept in English where Thai devs say them that way (`monitor`, `queue`, `session`, `proxy`, `gramJS`, `MTProxy`, `WebSocket`, `dashboard`, `container`, `Stories`, `release notes`, `PiP`, `fullscreen`, `Backfill`, `Rescue`).
- **`en.json` recapped to proper English casing**:
  - **Buttons / form labels / nav items / tab names** → Title Case (`Save Credentials`, `Add Account`, `Browse Chats`, `Run Again`, `Restart Monitor`, `Telegram API`).
  - **Help text / descriptions / toasts / confirmations** → sentence case with terminal periods.
  - **Acronyms** always ALL CAPS: PiP, HTTPS, JSON, SQLite, OTP, FloodWait, MTProxy, NTP, WAL, etc.
  - **Tech proper nouns** kept verbatim: Telegram, GitHub, Docker, Express, gramJS, IBM, GHCR.
- All 635 keys preserved (parity 635 / 635); every `{placeholder}` token, `_html` markup, code span, and URL untouched.
- **SW VERSION** bumped `'v12'` → `'v13'` so the recapped strings actually reach the browser instead of being served from the previous cache.

## [2.3.12] — 2026-04-28

### Added
- **Settings → Video Player** now covers every realistic playback preference. New options on top of v2.3.9's autoplay/start-muted/loop/auto-advance/resume/default-speed/default-volume:
  - **Show Picture-in-Picture button** (toggle) — hide if you never use PiP, frees toolbar space.
  - **Show speed button** (toggle) — same idea; default speed is still configurable below.
  - **Double-tap to fullscreen** (toggle) — defaults ON to match legacy behaviour.
  - **Skip step (s)** (number, 1–60, default 5) — controls how far ← / → arrow keys jump. Shift-arrow now jumps `step × 2` for power users.
  - **Hide controls after (s)** (number, 1–30, default 3) — auto-hide delay for the player toolbar.

### Changed
- **Sidebar "Viewer" entry removed** — was a third redundant entry-point to the same `#/viewer` page (the "All Media" card right below + the bottom-nav "Library" item already cover it). Cleaner sidebar; no functional change.
- **Update-check cache TTL: 1 h → 10 min** to shorten the window between a release going live and the dashboard showing the update pill. Cache is shared across all clients of one instance, so 6 upstream calls per hour total is comfortably under GitHub's 60-req-per-hour-per-IP unauthenticated rate limit.
- **Service-worker cache** bumped `'v11'` → `'v12'` to flush the older cached JS for users upgrading through this release.

### i18n
- 18 new keys (10 settings labels/help + 8 toast confirmations), en + th lockstep, 635 keys total.

## [2.3.11] — 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **Service-worker cache was holding stale `settings.js` + `index.html` for users who pulled v2.3.5–v2.3.10.** SW `VERSION` was last bumped to `'v3'` in v2.3.4 and never since (despite the comment "Going forward, this string bumps with every meaningful release" — sorry). Result: a user pulled v2.3.7 → v2.3.10, the new HTML loaded fine (network-first for navigation), but `/js/settings.js` stayed cached (cache-first for static assets) so the new Video Player toggles rendered with no behaviour wired. Bumped to `'v11'`; the activate handler purges every non-matching cache key on first hit, so the upgrade is one reload.
- **Update-check cache was 6 hours.** That window meant a fresh release could be live for hours before the dashboard's update pill appeared. TTL lowered to **1 hour**; additionally the cache is **bypassed when the running container is at-or-newer than the cached `latest`** (means we just rolled forward and a release was probably published in the window — re-fetch instead of trusting the stale "no update" answer).

### Added
- **IBM Plex Sans + IBM Plex Mono + IBM Plex Sans Thai** as the primary UI / mono / Thai fonts. Thai users get a font that ships proper Thai letterforms instead of falling back to the system; mono digits in the time block / queue size column / log viewer become consistent across browsers. Roboto kept in the fallback stack so an offline session that already cached it still renders cleanly.

### Changed
- **Branded range-slider** styling now covers every range input (player volume, Settings → Video Player default volume, plus a `.tg-range` class for future inputs). 14 × 14 white thumb with brand-blue ring on a 4 px track in both Webkit + Firefox. Settings → Video Player volume slider now matches the player's exactly instead of rendering the UA default.

## [2.3.10] — 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **Video player controls layout was jittery + the volume slider clashed with the time text.** The volume slider used a `w-0 → group-hover:w-20` collapse trick that pushed every control to its right (including the `00:00 / 00:00` time block) sideways every time the cursor crossed the mute button. Worse, hover-only meant touch users couldn't reach it at all.
  - Volume slider is now **always visible at 80 px on `sm:` and up** (hidden on phones — system volume buttons + the mute toggle cover that case better).
  - Each child of the controls row has a **fixed footprint** (play `40 × 40`, mute `36 × 36`, volume `80 × 4`, speed/PiP/FS `36 × 36` each); the time block is mono-font with `tabular-nums` so digits don't reflow as the clip plays.
  - Right cluster (speed / PiP / fullscreen) is pinned to the right via a `flex-1` spacer instead of `justify-between` on the parent — separates layout intent from the inner spacing so a future toolbar item can slot in cleanly.
  - **Polished volume thumb**: 12 × 12 white circle with brand-blue ring, custom track height 4 px on both Webkit and Firefox. Default UA thumb was comically large on Chromium and barely visible on Firefox.
  - Speed button reads `1×` (multiplication sign) instead of `1x` (lowercase x) — matches the dropdown labels in Settings → Video Player.

## [2.3.9] — 2026-04-28

### Added
- **Settings → Video Player** — dedicated section for every playback preference. All settings are browser-side (`localStorage`), no server round-trip; the viewer module reads the same keys on every clip `.load()` so changes take effect on the next open.
  - **Autoplay videos** — start playing automatically on open. Falls back to a muted start if the browser blocks autoplay-with-sound.
  - **Start muted** — toggles the saved mute state explicitly (also satisfies most browsers' autoplay policy).
  - **Loop video** — `<video loop>` flag, restarts the clip at the end.
  - **Auto-advance to next** — when a video ends and looping is off, opens the next file in the gallery automatically (60 ms debounce so the previous `onended` returns first).
  - **Remember position** — toggle to disable the existing per-clip resume behaviour. Defaults to ON to preserve legacy behaviour; the saved per-clip key is preserved when off so re-enabling restores everyone's history.
  - **Default playback speed** — bound directly to the existing `video-speed` localStorage key, so changing it propagates to every player open instantly.
  - **Default volume** — same pattern, bound to `video-volume` (0–100% slider with live label).
- **i18n**: 12 new keys for the settings labels + helper text + toast confirmations (en + th lockstep, 621 keys total).

## [2.3.8] — 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **Backfill page "Recent backfills" was showing the same chat several times** when the user re-ran a job (e.g., a Failed run + a manual retry produced two visible rows). Recent list is now deduped by `(groupId, limit)` — the **newest attempt** is shown, with a small `× N attempts` badge surfacing how many earlier runs were folded in. Different limits for the same chat (`Last 100` vs `All`) stay as separate rows because they're genuinely different actions. Underlying `data/history-jobs.json` still records every attempt for audit; only the UI list collapses.
- **i18n**: `backfill.row.attempts`, `backfill.row.attempts_help` (en + th lockstep, 598 keys).

## [2.3.7] — 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **History backpressure abort** ("History backpressure timed out (5min) — downloader appears stuck") now only fires when the downloader genuinely makes **zero forward progress** during the wait window. The previous logic counted from when the queue first hit the cap and aborted at +5 min regardless of how many downloads completed in that window — a slow large clip, a heavy FloodWait throttle, or any sustained-but-progressing run could trip it. The new check subscribes to the downloader's `complete` event AND watches `pendingCount` for a decrease; either resets the no-progress timer. The abort message now includes the actual pending count + cap so it's clear whether the cause is a stalled worker (FloodWait, network) or a misconfigured cap. Combined with the v2.3.6 FloodWait infinite-retry fix, the spurious 5-min abort should be gone in practice.

## [2.3.6] — 2026-04-28

A blocker fix in the gallery (libraries with thousands of files were capped at ~209 visible), plus the priority items from a third audit pass — silent FloodWait loops, Windows-reserved filenames, downloader/rotator races, queue UX overhaul, and the avatar flicker.

### Fixed — blocker
- **All Media was capped at ~400 files.** `loadAllFiles()` was hard-coded to fetch the first 20 groups × 20 files each, with no pagination and no infinite-scroll. A library with 2454 files would render only ~209 in the gallery (and Photos / Videos tabs ~30–50 each). New endpoint `GET /api/downloads/all?page&limit&type` orders by `created_at DESC` across every group, the SPA's existing `setupInfiniteScroll` sentinel pages it, and the per-tab type filter is now a server-side `?type=` query so the count under each tab is accurate. Also fixed an off-by-one where a perfectly-packed last page kept pagination armed forever.

### Fixed — critical
- **FloodWait retry was a tight infinite loop.** `downloader.js:717` called `return this.download(job, attempt)` *without* incrementing `attempt`, so a sustained throttle would re-enter forever. Now tracks FloodWait retries on a separate counter (`MAX_FLOOD_RETRIES = 8`); the normal retry budget stays untouched but a persistent flood gives up cleanly.
- **`sanitizeName()` produced filenames Windows refuses to open.** A chat literally named `CON`, `PRN`, `AUX`, `NUL`, `COM1`–`COM9`, or `LPT1`–`LPT9` (with or without an extension) would land in a folder Windows can't even `stat`. Reserved-name check now prefixes with `_`. Also switched the truncation from `slice(0, 80)` (UTF-16 char count → mid-codepoint cut on multibyte chars) to UTF-8 byte truncation that backs off to the last full codepoint.
- **Rename collision silently overwrote.** `fs.rename(.part, final)` is destructive on every major platform — two accounts that produced the same final filename would see one's content quietly replace the other's, with the earlier DB row pointing at the wrong bytes. Now suffixes ` (1)`, ` (2)` … on collision.
- **Disk-rotator could delete a file the downloader was mid-writing.** Caused intermittent `Downloaded file is empty (0 bytes)` failures in the wild because the rotator's sweep would unlink the `.part` out from under the active download. Downloader now publishes `_activeFilePaths: Set<string>`; the rotator's constructor takes a `getActiveFilePaths` accessor and skips any candidate whose absolute path is in the Set.
- **gramJS keep-alive kept hammering throttled DCs.** The `Api.PingDelayDisconnect` catch was logging FloodWait but pinging again 60 s later. Now serves a 10-minute backoff per offending account before the next ping; warn lines are still coalesced to one per 5 min.

### Fixed — UX
- **Avatar flicker on every sidebar re-render.** `/api/groups/:id/photo` was inheriting the global `/api/*` `Cache-Control: no-store` policy, so every `renderGroupsList()` paint forced a fresh round-trip and a brief flash. The endpoint now overrides with `private, max-age=86400, stale-while-revalidate=604800` — bytes are content-addressed by group ID and rewritten in place when the photo changes, so the long TTL is safe.
- **Queue page overhaul.**
  - Finished rows are clickable and open the matching media in the in-app viewer (image / video / audio).
  - Cancel + dismiss now go through the themed `confirmSheet` (was instant, easy to mis-tap).
  - Progress bar reads 100 % when status is `done` (was stuck at 0 %); shows blank for queued (was 0 %).
  - Size column shows `…` for queued items whose size hasn't been negotiated yet, `—` only when truly unknown.
  - Real thumbnail (image / video poster) for finished rows where we know the file path; the icon stays as fallback.
- **Forwarder delete-after-forward unlink failure** is now logged at WARN with the filename instead of swallowed inside the upload catch — the integrity sweep will eventually reap the orphan.

### Fixed — DB performance
- **`busy_timeout = 5000`** added at boot. A long write (rescue / disk-rotator bulk delete) used to fail concurrent reads instantly with `SQLITE_BUSY`; now waits up to 5 s.
- **`wal_autocheckpoint = 1000`** explicit. Tames `-wal` growth on sustained writes.
- **Hot-path prepared-statement cache.** `isDownloaded()` and `fileAlreadyStored()` were re-preparing the same SQL on every call (called per message in every monitor pass); module-level `_prep()` cache fixes that.

### Added — endpoint + i18n
- `GET /api/downloads/all` for the All Media surface.
- `queue.confirm.cancel_title`, `queue.confirm.cancel` in en + th lockstep (596 keys total).

## [2.3.5] — 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **Telegram release notifier was sending raw Markdown.** `.github/workflows/telegram-notify.yml` was POSTing the release body to `sendMessage` with `parse_mode=HTML` after only HTML-escaping it — so `**bold**`, `### headers`, and `` `code` `` shipped as literal characters. Replaced the escape step with a tiny inline Python pass that converts the GitHub-Markdown subset we actually use (headers, bold, italic, inline code, fenced code, bullets, links, hrules) into the matching Telegram-HTML subset (`<b>`, `<i>`, `<code>`, `<pre>`, `<a>`, `•`) before sending. Code blocks and inline code stay HTML-safe; the link `[text](url)` form is preserved.

## [2.3.4] — 2026-04-28

Last items from the multi-pass audit. Closes the remaining "deferred" tasks: WS reconnect storm, sheet stacking edge case, log-read hang, stale service-worker cache.

### Fixed
- **WebSocket reconnect storm.** ws.js now caps automatic reconnects at 12 attempts (~6 minutes of capped backoff) and emits a `__ws_giveup` pseudo-event. The status bar paints the WS dot orange + shows a one-time toast and a click-to-retry handler, instead of leaving the user staring at a silent red dot with no way to recover other than refresh.
- **Sheet stacking backdrop click.** Backdrop click on a sheet that's no longer the topmost no-ops, so a stacked Sheet B's backdrop can't fall through and close the underlying Sheet A.
- **Log-read hang in Maintenance.** `fetch /api/maintenance/logs/download` now uses an AbortController with a 30 s ceiling, releases the in-flight server-side stream on abort, and surfaces a clear "log read timed out" message instead of leaving the View button disabled forever.
- **Service-worker cache stuck on `v1`.** The static `VERSION = 'v1'` meant deploys never invalidated the shell + asset caches automatically. Bumped to `v3`; the `activate` handler will purge the old `tgdl-shell-v1` / `tgdl-assets-v1` caches on first hit. (Going forward, this string bumps with every meaningful release.)
- **i18n keys.** `ws.giveup`, `ws.giveup_retry`, `maintenance.logs.timeout` in en + th lockstep (594 keys total).

## [2.3.3] — 2026-04-28

Second-pass audit plus four additional defects surfaced in production. Fixes a real entity-cache shape bug and a path-traversal hole in the profile-photo endpoint that the first audit missed.

### Fixed — security
- **Path traversal in `/api/groups/:id/photo`** — `req.params.id` was interpolated straight into a filesystem path with no validation. A request like `/api/groups/..%2F..%2Fetc%2Fpasswd/photo` could escape `PHOTOS_DIR`. Now requires `id` to match `/^-?\d+$/` (signed Telegram ID) and runs a `fs.realpathSync` check before `sendFile`.
- **CSRF defence-in-depth.** Added an Origin / Referer same-host check to every `POST` / `PUT` / `PATCH` / `DELETE`. Requests with neither header (CLI, native clients) pass through — the `sameSite=strict` cookie still gates them.
- **Prototype-pollution filter** on the `POST /api/config` body. Strips `__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype` keys recursively before any `{ ...currentConfig, ...req.body }` spread.

### Fixed — backend correctness
- **`entityCache` shape bug.** First lookup returned `{ entity, client }`, but the cache stored only `entity`. Every subsequent cache hit returned a bare entity, so callers reading `r.entity` got `undefined` and silently fell through to "unknown chat" naming. Cache now stores `{ entity, client, at }`, has a 30-min TTL, and a 5000-entry hard cap so it can't grow without bound.
- **`saveConfig()` was not atomic.** `fs.writeFileSync(CONFIG_PATH, json)` could be observed mid-write by `fs.watch` consumers (monitor.js's `reloadConfig`), making `JSON.parse` throw on a half-written file. Switched to temp-file + `fs.renameSync()` (atomic on POSIX + NTFS).
- **Standalone-downloader IIFEs** in `/api/stories/download` and `/api/download/url` had no error boundary — a throw inside the drain loop became an unhandled rejection. Wrapped in `.catch()`.
- **`/api/dialogs` cache TTL** could become permanent if the system clock jumped backward (NTP correction). Wrapped the `now - cache.at` comparisons in `Math.max(0, …)`.
- **EADDRINUSE on `server.listen()`** failed silently — the container exited with no clue where to look. Added an `error` handler that prints a clear "Port X is already in use" message and `process.exit(1)`.

### Fixed — frontend
- **VideoPlayer seek bar + play/pause didn't reset between clips** — switching clips from the gallery left the progress bar mid-track and the play icon showing the previous clip's state, because a stale `ontimeupdate` from the OLD source could fire after `load()` reset the UI but before the new src had taken over. Now explicitly `pause()` + `currentTime = 0` + null `onloadedmetadata` BEFORE the UI reset.
- **Backfill `startElapsedTimer()` defensive guard** — clears any existing interval before re-arming so a router double-fire on `#/backfill` can't stack two tickers.

## [2.3.2] — 2026-04-28

Audit-driven defect sweep — fixes uncovered while reviewing v2.3.1 in detail. No new feature surface; everything below is correctness, leak-prevention, or UX polish.

### Fixed — frontend
- **VideoPlayer fullscreen listener leak.** Every viewer open used to attach a fresh `fullscreenchange` listener on `document` without removing the previous one. After 100 opens, 100 stale callbacks fired on every F11. Listener ref is now stored on the player instance and detached in `unload()` / `destroy()`.
- **VideoPlayer resume race.** `onloadedmetadata` from a previous clip could fire after a new clip had loaded and seek the new file to the wrong timestamp. The handler is now nulled in `unload()` so a stale resume can't bleed across clips.
- **Backfill page elapsed-time ticker leak.** `setInterval` fired every 1 s for the rest of the tab's life even after navigating away from `#/backfill`. Router now calls `stopBackfillPage()` on route change.
- **Status-bar double-bound on hot reload.** `initStatusBar()` had no idempotence guard, so a stray double call (recovery flow, dev hot-reload) bound every WS handler twice and fired each event 2×. Added `_booted` guard.
- **Update-pill dismiss double-fire.** Rapid clicks on the new update notifier's × could fire the dismiss handler twice before the badge hid. Added per-paint `dismissing` guard.
- **i18n early-bootstrap race.** Modules that translated during bootstrap (before `initI18n()` resolved) saw an empty dict. Added a `ready` promise consumers can `await`.
- **Gallery section headers were `position: sticky`** inside a CSS Grid, which clipped trailing tiles and stacked multiple "Today / Yesterday / …" headers at the top of the scrollport while scrolling. Reverted to inline static headers.
- **`setting-max-disk` dropdown was non-functional** — the `<input list>` datalist autocomplete didn't render a clickable arrow on most browsers / mobile. Replaced with a real numeric input + unit `<select>` (MB / GB / TB). Legacy free-form values like "500GB", "1.5 TB", "250 MB" still parse correctly on load.
- **Light-mode dim text** — labels like "Downloaded Groups" in the sidebar were rendered in `#65737E` on a `#F4F4F5` background, which barely passed contrast and needed hover to read. Bumped `.text-tg-textSecondary` to `#4B5563` (Tailwind gray-600) in light mode for headers and footer captions.
- **Borderless inputs in both themes** — `.tg-input` was declared `border: none` in dark mode and only `<input>` (not `<select>`) got a light-mode border, so dropdowns blended into their card background. Added a subtle 1 px border in dark mode (`#38444D`, hovers to `#4A5C6E`, focuses to the brand blue) and broadened the light-mode rule to cover both inputs and selects.
- **`.tg-btn-secondary` had no base CSS in dark mode** — the class was used on dozens of buttons (Save credentials, Export, Resync, Restart, log View/Copy/Download, Backfill presets, Remove account, …) but only had a light-mode override. Dark-mode buttons fell back to the browser default and looked broken. Added a proper base style (panel-grey background, subtle border, hover + active + disabled states) and tightened the light-mode override to match.

### Fixed — backend
- **Schema migrations now smoke-tested at boot.** The `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` migrations were wrapped in `try/catch` to ignore "column already exists", which also swallowed real failures (out-of-disk, locked DB, corrupt schema). A `SELECT pinned, pending_until, rescued_at, ttl_seconds, file_hash FROM downloads LIMIT 0` after the migration block forces "no such column" failures to surface at boot instead of mid-download.
- **Graceful shutdown** on `SIGTERM` / `SIGINT`. Stops the integrity sweep, rescue sweeper, disk rotator, monitor, and keep-alive ping; closes every WebSocket with code 1001; drains the HTTP server. Hard-exit safety net at 5 s. Makes `docker compose restart` snappy and stops phantom WS reconnect attempts during the bounce.
- **`/api/maintenance/logs/download` realpath check.** Basename filter alone could be tricked by a symlinked log entry on case-insensitive FS; now both sides are resolved with `fs.realpathSync` and compared against `LOGS_DIR`.
- **`/api/maintenance/resync-dialogs` batched in a single transaction** instead of N `UPDATE` statements between every async `resolveEntityAcrossAccounts` call. Avoids WAL contention with concurrent gallery readers.
- **Keep-alive FloodWait surfaced.** The `Api.PingDelayDisconnect` catch was silent — a throttled DC kept getting pinged, digging the FloodWait deeper. Now logs once per account per 5-minute window when the failure is FloodWait, and clears the warn cache once a ping lands cleanly.
- **Monitor delete-event errors logged.** `handleDeleteEvent` failures (DB locked, FloodWait, missing row) used to vanish into a silent catch — the rescue panel never learned why a "rescued" badge didn't appear. Now warns to the console.

### Added — i18n
- **7 keys that the code referenced but were absent from the locale files** (rendered as raw key strings or fallback text in the UI): `backfill.row.cancel_title`, `purge.all.title`, `purge.all.title2`, `purge.group.title`, `settings.size.total_disk_help`, `viewer.bulk.title`, `viewer.delete.title`.
- **Thai locale fully humanized.** All 591 strings rewritten in natural conversational Thai instead of stiff machine-translation tone. Tech terms (`monitor`, `queue`, `download`, `session`, `proxy`, `worker`, `dashboard`, `cookie`, `Stories`, `Backfill`, `FloodWait`, `gramJS`, `Maintenance`, `Rescue`, `VACUUM`, …) kept in English where that's how Thai users actually say them. Confirmations made direct, help text rewritten in a friendly explanatory tone, possessive `ของคุณ` spam removed, every `{placeholder}` token preserved.

## [2.3.1] — 2026-04-28

### Added
- **In-dashboard update notifier.** New `GET /api/version/check` (public) polls `api.github.com/repos/.../releases/latest`, caches the result for 6 h server-side, and degrades fail-soft (last-known-good cache served on transient errors; cold-start unreachable returns `updateAvailable:false` rather than blanking the UI). The status-bar shows a clickable **"Update available → vX.Y.Z"** pill linking to the release page when the latest tag is newer than the running version (semver-numeric compare, pre-release suffix ignored). Per-version dismiss button writes to `localStorage` so the same release is never re-nagged; a per-session toast fires once so users notice on first load even if the chip is offscreen on a narrow viewport.
- **i18n keys.** `update.available`, `update.toast`, `update.click_for_release`, `update.dismiss` (en + th lockstep).

## [2.3.0] — 2026-04-28

A large quality-of-life release. Web dashboard learns to do every CLI op, the download pipeline self-heals, and four new top-level surfaces ship.

### Added — major features
- **Queue page** (`#/queue`) — IDM-style download manager. Sortable + filterable table of every job (Active / Queued / Paused / Failed / Done) with per-row pause / resume / cancel / retry, global pause-all / resume-all / clear-finished, throttle slider (max 50 MB/s), virtualised render handles 1000+ jobs without lag. WS-driven; survives a tab reload via `data/queue-history.json`.
- **Backfill page** (`#/backfill`) — promoted from a panel-buried-in-modal to a first-class surface. Three cards: active jobs (live progress + cancel), start-a-new-backfill (group picker + preset chips 100/1k/10k/All/custom), recent jobs (last 30 days). Deep-linkable per-group via `#/backfill/<groupId>`. Cancel actually aborts the in-flight gramJS download (mid-stream throw + .part cleanup), not just dequeues.
- **Rescue Mode** — per-group option that keeps only messages deleted from Telegram source within a retention window. New DB columns `pending_until` + `rescued_at`, monitor subscribes to `UpdateDeleteChannelMessages` + `UpdateDeleteMessages` across every connected account, sweeper auto-prunes anything still on Telegram after the window. Per-group override of the global default.
- **Maintenance panel** (Settings) — CLI-free ops surface: resync Telegram dialogs, restart monitor, DB integrity check + VACUUM, view + download log files in-browser, view raw `config.json` as a collapsible JSON tree, export a Telegram session string (password-gated, blurred until reveal, auto-clears in 60 s), sign-out-everywhere, force file-integrity verify. Web-only password reset flow (token printed to `docker logs` on a fresh container).
- **PWA support** — `manifest.webmanifest` + service worker + install prompt. Add-to-home-screen on mobile, Install button on desktop Chrome/Edge. SW caches the app shell + bypasses `/api/*`, `/files/*`, `/photos/*`, `/metrics`, `/ws`, and the auth pages.
- **Auto-rotate** — disk quota sweeper. When `diskManagement.maxTotalSize` is exceeded, deletes oldest unpinned downloads first. Runs every `sweepIntervalMin` (default 10 min). Toggle in Settings → Size Limits.
- **Settings → Advanced** — 14 hot-path constants surfaced as runtime-configurable settings (downloader concurrency limits, history backpressure cap + break intervals, disk-rotator batch size, integrity sweep interval, web session TTL, …). Defaults preserve existing behaviour.

### Added — operational
- **Status-bar version chip** ("v2.3.0 · sha7") at the bottom-right, links to the matching commit on GitHub. Auto-bumps on every CI push (`docker build --build-arg GIT_SHA=…`).
- **Self-healing downloads.** `downloader.js` re-stats the final file after `fs.rename` and retries on 0-byte / missing files (NFS quirks, mid-write crash). Boot-time + hourly integrity sweep walks every `downloads` row and drops the ones whose file is gone. `/files/*` 404s also background-prune the matching DB row by exact `file_path` match.
- **Monitor auto-start on container boot** when at least one account is loaded and at least one group is enabled. Opt out via `monitor.autoStart: false`.
- **Keep-alive ping** every 60 s (`Api.PingDelayDisconnect` with 90 s extension) to stop the per-DC reconnect cascade that used to fill `network.log` to multi-MB sizes.
- **`network.log` rotation** at 5 MB per file, 2 generations kept (10 MB cap total). No log lines ever skipped — only rotated.
- **`/api/version`** (public) — `{ version, commit, builtAt }` for the status-bar chip + bug reports.
- **`/api/queue/*`** — snapshot, per-job pause/resume/cancel/retry, global pause-all/resume-all/cancel-all/clear-finished, throttle save.
- **`/api/maintenance/*`** — resync-dialogs, restart-monitor, db/integrity, db/vacuum, files/verify, logs (list + download), config/raw, session/export (password-gated), sessions/revoke-all (password-gated).
- **`/api/rescue/stats`** — pending / rescued / cleared counters for the Settings panel.

### Added — UI/UX polish
- **Themed `confirmSheet` + `promptSheet`** primitives in `sheet.js` — every native `confirm()` / `alert()` / `window.prompt()` in the SPA replaced with focus-trapped, drag-dismissible, brand-styled dialogs.
- **Per-row settings cog** in the Downloaded Groups sidebar — one tap into Group Settings.
- **Header view-mode toggle** cycles grid → compact → list, persisted in localStorage.
- **Telegram-style chat avatar** in the page header, mirrors the sidebar's avatar+initial when entering a group.
- **Light-theme polish** across every newer panel (Queue, Backfill, Rescue, Maintenance, sheets, status bar).
- **Tg-toggle** bumped from 36×20 → 44×24 with a soft thumb shadow.
- **Total-Disk input** is a free-form text box with datalist suggestions (50GB → 10TB) instead of a 5-option dropdown.
- **In-browser log viewer** (`<pre>` with auto-scroll-to-bottom + Copy + Download fallback).
- **Collapsible JSON tree** for raw config.json with Expand/Collapse-all + Copy.
- **Session-export blur shield** — string is `blur-sm` until the user clicks Reveal; auto-clears in 60 s; manual Clear button; red-tinted warning card.

### Added — i18n
- **bilingual coverage** (English + Thai) brought from 65 keys at v2.1 → 580 keys at v2.3, every interactive surface routed through `i18nT()` / `i18nTf()` (interpolation helper). en/th key parity enforced in CI smoke + audit agents.

### Fixed — security
- **`_requirePassword` bypass**. `loginVerify` returns `{ok, upgrade?}`, NOT a bare boolean. The previous `!loginVerify(...)` check made any non-empty string a valid password on Export Session and Sign-out-everywhere — a full account-takeover vector for anyone with a session cookie. Now reads `result?.ok` like every other call site.
- **Password-gate** on Export Session + Sign-out-everywhere — even with a valid cookie, the user has to retype their dashboard password. Mitigates session-hijacker abuse.

### Fixed — correctness
- **"Unknown chat" leaking everywhere.** Server-side `bestGroupName(id, configName, dbName, dialogsName)` resolves in priority: live Telegram dialogs cache → config → DB → "Unknown chat (#id)" placeholder. SQL `MAX(group_name)` was returning the literal string "Unknown" because it sorts above most ASCII titles — CASE-filtered before MAX. Live `getDialogsNameCache()` shares the same source as the Browse-chats picker (5 min TTL, 5 min cache for full `/api/dialogs` body).
- **Filter → viewer wrong file**. Tile data-index pointed into the filtered list; viewer indexed `state.files[idx]` (unfiltered). Photos-filter + click photo #3 was opening a video. Now passes `originalIndex` + filter-aware prev/next.
- **Filtered-list-aware prev/next** in the viewer, double-tap-left/right to seek ±10 s on mobile.
- **Search-input dead handler** — was selecting `.group-item` (renamed to `.chat-row` long ago).
- **Bottom-nav Engine highlight** — tab lit up Settings instead of Engine; new `navKey` override on `renderPage`.
- **`/api/downloads/search` shadowed** by `/api/downloads/:groupId` — the catch-all route was matching first; now short-circuits on `groupId === 'search'`.
- **Browser notification dead handler** — runtime broadcast spreads inner type so the outer `monitor_event` envelope never reached subscribers; switched to `download_complete` directly.
- **Gallery ghost tiles** after auto-prune / disk-rotate / rescue-sweep — `file_deleted` WS handler now drops the matching tile + refreshes stats.
- **Atomic config writes** — every `fs.writeFile(CONFIG_PATH, …)` (9 callsites) routed through `writeConfigAtomic(config)`. Previously a crash mid-write left a corrupt config.

### Fixed — Docker / deployment
- **`Cannot find module '/app/src/web/server.js'`** at runtime — `chmod -R a+rX /app` between mkdir and chown in the Dockerfile (BuildKit on Windows hosts was laying down mode-0 layers).
- **Bind-mounted `/app/data` permissions** — entrypoint now runs as root, `chown -R node:node /app/data`, then `su-exec` drops to node before exec'ing the CMD.
- **Stale local images** — compose defaults to GHCR `:latest` with `pull_policy: always`; local dev can still build from source by uncommenting `build:`.
- **CI smoke test** verifies the built image actually runs (file perms, healthcheck within 30 s, app process running as `node` not root).

### Fixed — performance
- **Video playback lag** — `/files/*` cache bumped from 60 s → `private, max-age=2592000, immutable` (downloaded files are content-immutable). Browser stops revalidating every 64 KB range chunk through the auth + path-resolve pipeline.
- **Per-request config disk-read** — `readConfigSafe()` memoised for 2 s. During a video playback, force-https + checkAuth no longer disk-read on every range chunk.
- **Sidebar flicker** on WS bursts — cache `_lastHtml` and skip the `innerHTML` reassignment when nothing changed.
- **`/api/monitor/status` polling** consolidated behind one shared module (was duplicated 3× across modules); cadence dropped from 3 s → 30 s safety net (WS handlers cover the active updates).
- **`/api/stats`** throttled from 15 s → 60 s + WS-driven refresh on every `download_complete` / `file_deleted` / `bulk_delete` / `purge_*`.
- **Login + setup brute-force limiters** stay on regardless of the global rate-limit toggle.

### Changed
- **API rate limit toggle** — now opt-in (default off) for self-hosted private dashboards. Previous 600/min default was masking real load as 429s on chatty SPAs.
- **`force HTTPS`** is opt-in, default off.

### Removed
- Inline `confirm()` / `alert()` / `window.prompt()` calls in the SPA — every callsite now routes through the themed sheet primitive.

## [2.2.0] — 2026-04-27

### Added — observability
- **`GET /metrics`** — OpenMetrics / Prometheus 0.0.4 text format. Zero-dep collector in `src/core/metrics.js` fed by `src/core/runtime.js` events. Counters for downloads / failures / history jobs / URL + Stories pulls / login outcomes; gauges for queue depth, active downloads, workers, accounts, monitor state; histogram for download duration; standard `process_*` gauges. Endpoint registered before the auth middleware so a scrape job without a session cookie still reaches it. Optional `?token=…` gating via `TGDL_METRICS_TOKEN`.

### Fixed
- **Docker: `Cannot find module '/app/src/web/server.js'`** at runtime. Two compounding causes:
  1. **Mode-0 COPY layers.** BuildKit (Windows hosts and some gha-cache hits) was laying down `/app/src/*` and `/app/scripts/*` with mode `0` — `node` user owned the files but had no read permission, so Node returned ENOENT-shaped errors on EACCES traversal. Fixed by `chmod -R a+rX /app` between mkdir and chown in the Dockerfile.
  2. **Stale local images.** `docker compose up` reused locally-cached `telegram-media-downloader:latest` from a prior build instead of pulling fresh. The compose file now defaults to the prebuilt GHCR image (`ghcr.io/botnick/telegram-media-downloader:latest`) with `pull_policy: always` — `docker compose up -d` always grabs the current release. Local dev can still build from source by uncommenting `build:`.
- **`Telegram connection failed: ENOENT … data/config.json`** on every first boot. `connectTelegram()` blindly read `config.json` before the user had set anything up. It now returns silently when the file is missing or has no `apiId` / `apiHash`, and only logs a real error for non-ENOENT failures. The boot banner is also state-aware now: "First run? Open …" / "Open … and run `npm run auth` …" / "Sign in at …" depending on setup state. Banner reads the version from `package.json` directly so it shows the real version even when started with bare `node src/web/server.js`.

### Operational
- **CI smoke test for the Docker image.** `.github/workflows/docker.yml` now runs the freshly-built image, verifies file permissions are sane, and polls the in-container healthcheck for 30 s. A green build now means the image actually boots — not just that the Dockerfile parses.
- **Dockerfile cleanup.** Dropped `ENV TGDL_RUN=monitor` (only `runner.js` reads it; CMD runs `server.js`) and `COPY watchdog.ps1` (PowerShell script, unusable in Alpine).

## [2.1.0] — 2026-04-26

### Added — UI/UX overhaul (Telegram-grade desktop + mobile)
- **Hash router** with deep-linking (`#/viewer`, `#/groups/<id>`, `#/settings/<section>`, `#/stories`, `#/account/add`). Browser back/forward + URL share work everywhere.
- **Sheet primitive** — bottom-sheet on mobile (drag handle + swipe-to-dismiss), centered card on desktop. Drives shortcuts, destination picker, paste-link, stories, FAB action sheet. Focus trap + Esc-closes-topmost.
- **Mobile bottom navigation** (Library / Chats / Engine / Settings) replaces drawer-only switching at `< 768px`.
- **Floating action button** opens a Quick-Actions sheet (paste link, stories, add account, browse chats).
- Sidebar breakpoint moved from `lg` → `md` so 768–1023px ranges no longer get a cramped sidebar.
- **Telegram-style chat rows** for sidebar groups + dialog picker — avatar 48 px, bold name, last-activity subtitle, time-on-right, status pill, "selected chat" left bar.
- **Story-ring avatars** — animated conic-gradient ring around groups currently downloading; green status dot when monitoring; clears on `monitor_state=stopped`.
- **Gestures**: long-press in gallery enters select mode; pull-to-refresh on the viewer; swipe ←/→ between items in the modal viewer; vertical drag-down dismisses the viewer.
- **Time-grouped gallery** sections (Today / Yesterday / Earlier this week / Older) with sticky headers.
- **Skeletons** in the gallery and sidebar while data loads — no more empty/spinner pages.
- **i18n** with English + ไทย locales; Settings → Appearance → Language picker (Auto / English / ไทย); persisted in localStorage and applied without reload.
- A11y: real `aria-label` on every icon-only button (translatable), `min-h/w-[44px]` touch targets, `:focus-visible` Telegram-blue outline, `role="switch"` + Space/Enter on every `.tg-toggle`, `prefers-reduced-motion` respected for transitions and ring animation.
- Status bar hidden on mobile (where the bottom nav is the source of truth).

### Fixed
- Sidebar rows showing `Unknown · -1003666421064` with no avatar. PUT `/api/groups/:id` and `downloadProfilePhoto` now resolve via the multi-account `AccountManager` (with the legacy single-session client as a last-resort fallback). New endpoint `POST /api/groups/refresh-info` walks every config + DB-only group and back-fills the real name and cached profile photo. The SPA auto-fires it whenever it detects a placeholder name.
- CSP `script-src-attr 'none'` had been blocking the inline `onclick`/`oninput` handlers in `index.html` (toggles, range sliders, modal close). Added `script-src-attr 'unsafe-inline'` so the existing markup keeps working until the Phase 4 follow-up migrates handlers to `addEventListener`.

### Changed
- `npm start` (and the bare `node src/index.js`) now boots the dashboard directly instead of dropping into the interactive CLI menu. The legacy menu is reachable via `npm run menu` for headless / power-user workflows.
- `runner.js` / `watchdog.ps1` already default to `monitor`; this release also adds a POSIX `runner.sh` (Linux/macOS).

### Operational
- `.github/workflows/telegram-notify.yml` rewritten — fires on both `push` to `main` and `release.published`. Pre-releases get a 🧪 badge, release notes are HTML-escaped + length-trimmed for Telegram's parser.
- `release-drafter` + Conventional-Commits autolabeler land via `.github/workflows/release-drafter.yml` + `.github/release-drafter.yml`. The next release notes draft themselves from merged PRs.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-04-26

### Added — security
- Web dashboard auth refactor: scrypt-hashed passwords (per-password random salt), random session tokens persisted to `data/web-sessions.json`, `crypto.timingSafeEqual` everywhere.
- **Fail-closed by default**: a fresh install no longer falls through to "open access" if no password is set — every API call returns 503 and every page redirects to a setup wizard.
- WebSocket upgrade handshake validates the same session cookie as REST.
- `helmet`, `express.json({limit:'256kb'})`, `express-rate-limit` on `/api/login` (10 / 15-min / IP).
- Path safety on `/api/file` and `/files/*`: NUL-byte rejection, `path.normalize`, `fs.realpath` symlink check, default `Content-Disposition: attachment`.
- Per-blob random scrypt salt for AES session storage (wire format v=2, v=1 still decrypts).
- LICENSE, SECURITY.md, vulnerability disclosure policy.
- `docs/AUDIT.md` — full 166-finding audit with severity table.

### Added — web parity
- First-run password setup + change-password flow entirely from the browser; CLI is no longer required for security setup.
- 4-step web wizard for adding Telegram accounts (label → phone → OTP → 2FA).
- Account list / remove from Settings → Telegram Accounts.
- `/api/monitor/{status,start,stop}` + Settings → Engine card with live state, queue, active workers, uptime.
- History backfill from the Group settings modal (one-tap 100 / 1k / 10k).
- Dialogs picker covers archived chats and (opt-in) DMs.

### Added — features
- **Download by Link** (`POST /api/download/url`): paste any `t.me/.../<msg>`, `/c/<id>/<msg>`, `/c/<id>/<topic>/<msg>`, `tg://resolve`, or `tg://privatepost` URL and pull just that media.
- **Telegram Stories**: username + per-story selection, queued through the regular downloader.
- **TTL/self-destructing media**: monitor detects `media.ttlSeconds` and front-loads the queue so the file is captured before expiry.
- **Forum topics**: per-group filter list with whitelist mode.
- **Proxy** (SOCKS4/5 + MTProxy) wired into the GramJS client; Settings UI with TCP-reachability test.
- **Light / Dark / Auto theme** with OS-detected default, persisted in localStorage.
- **Browser notifications** opt-in for download-complete events.
- **Sticky status bar**: monitor state, queue, active workers, total files, disk usage, WS link.
- **Gallery search + multi-select + bulk delete**, including server-side `searchDownloads()`.

### Added — engine
- Dual-lane queue (`_high` realtime + `queue` history) — realtime no longer competes with backfill; spillover only displaces history.
- `core/runtime.js` singleton orchestrates monitor + downloader + forwarder in-process for the web server.
- WebSocket client (`ws.js`) with auto-reconnect and visibility-aware backoff.
- Connection manager `stop()` + monitor cleanup tracking; intervals are `unref`-ed so the process can exit cleanly.
- Backpressure max-wait in history (5 minutes) so a stuck downloader can't hang the command forever.

### Changed
- `runner.js` and `watchdog.ps1` now read `TGDL_RUN` env (default `monitor`) instead of hard-coding `history` — production supervision actually keeps a long-running process alive.
- gramJS internal noise (`TIMEOUT`, `Not connected`, `Reconnect`, etc.) is now classified instead of silently dropped: it logs to `data/logs/network.log` and only surfaces in stderr when `TGDL_DEBUG=1`.

### Fixed
- Terminal raw-mode is restored on `exit` / SIGINT / SIGTERM — no more dead shells on crash.
- Plaintext apiId no longer printed at CLI startup.
- `.gitignore` malformed line removed; `docs/` is now tracked.
- Orphan `src/index.js_fragment_setupWebAuth` deleted.

### Migration notes
- Old `config.web.password` (plaintext) is auto-rehashed to `config.web.passwordHash` on first successful web login.
- Old AES blob format (`v=1`) keeps decrypting; new writes are `v=2`.
- Existing `data/db.sqlite` is migrated forward automatically — `ttl_seconds` and `file_hash` columns are added on first start.
