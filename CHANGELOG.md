# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.1.0] — 2026-04-26

### Added — UI/UX overhaul (Telegram-grade desktop + mobile)
- **Hash router** with deep-linking (`#/viewer`, `#/groups/<id>`, `#/settings/<section>`, `#/stories`, `#/account/add`). Browser back/forward + URL share work everywhere.
- **Sheet primitive** — bottom-sheet on mobile (drag handle + swipe-to-dismiss), centered card on desktop. Drives shortcuts, destination picker, paste-link, stories, FAB action sheet. Focus trap + Esc-closes-topmost.
- **Mobile bottom navigation** (Library / Chats / Engine / Settings) replaces drawer-only switching at `< 768px`.
- **Floating action button** opens a Quick-Actions sheet (paste link, stories, add account, browse chats).
- Sidebar breakpoint moved from `lg` → `md` so 768–1023px ranges no longer get a cramped sidebar.
- **Telegram-style chat rows** for sidebar groups + dialog picker — avatar 48 px, bold name, last-activity subtitle, time-on-right, status pill, "selected chat" left bar.
- **Story-ring avatars** — animated conic-gradient ring around groups currently downloading; green status dot when monitoring; clears on `monitor_state=stopped`.
- **Gestures**: long-press in gallery enters select mode; pull-to-refresh on the viewer; swipe ←/→ between items in the modal viewer; vertical drag-down dismisses the viewer.
- **Time-grouped gallery** sections (Today / Yesterday / Earlier this week / Older) with sticky headers.
- **Skeletons** in the gallery and sidebar while data loads — no more empty/spinner pages.
- **i18n** with English + ไทย locales; Settings → Appearance → Language picker (Auto / English / ไทย); persisted in localStorage and applied without reload.
- A11y: real `aria-label` on every icon-only button (translatable), `min-h/w-[44px]` touch targets, `:focus-visible` Telegram-blue outline, `role="switch"` + Space/Enter on every `.tg-toggle`, `prefers-reduced-motion` respected for transitions and ring animation.
- Status bar hidden on mobile (where the bottom nav is the source of truth).

### Fixed
- Sidebar rows showing `Unknown · -1003666421064` with no avatar. PUT `/api/groups/:id` and `downloadProfilePhoto` now resolve via the multi-account `AccountManager` (with the legacy single-session client as a last-resort fallback). New endpoint `POST /api/groups/refresh-info` walks every config + DB-only group and back-fills the real name and cached profile photo. The SPA auto-fires it whenever it detects a placeholder name.
- CSP `script-src-attr 'none'` had been blocking the inline `onclick`/`oninput` handlers in `index.html` (toggles, range sliders, modal close). Added `script-src-attr 'unsafe-inline'` so the existing markup keeps working until the Phase 4 follow-up migrates handlers to `addEventListener`.

### Changed
- `npm start` (and the bare `node src/index.js`) now boots the dashboard directly instead of dropping into the interactive CLI menu. The legacy menu is reachable via `npm run menu` for headless / power-user workflows.
- `runner.js` / `watchdog.ps1` already default to `monitor`; this release also adds a POSIX `runner.sh` (Linux/macOS).

### Operational
- `.github/workflows/telegram-notify.yml` rewritten — fires on both `push` to `main` and `release.published`. Pre-releases get a 🧪 badge, release notes are HTML-escaped + length-trimmed for Telegram's parser.
- `release-drafter` + Conventional-Commits autolabeler land via `.github/workflows/release-drafter.yml` + `.github/release-drafter.yml`. The next release notes draft themselves from merged PRs.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-04-26

### Added — security
- Web dashboard auth refactor: scrypt-hashed passwords (per-password random salt), random session tokens persisted to `data/web-sessions.json`, `crypto.timingSafeEqual` everywhere.
- **Fail-closed by default**: a fresh install no longer falls through to "open access" if no password is set — every API call returns 503 and every page redirects to a setup wizard.
- WebSocket upgrade handshake validates the same session cookie as REST.
- `helmet`, `express.json({limit:'256kb'})`, `express-rate-limit` on `/api/login` (10 / 15-min / IP).
- Path safety on `/api/file` and `/files/*`: NUL-byte rejection, `path.normalize`, `fs.realpath` symlink check, default `Content-Disposition: attachment`.
- Per-blob random scrypt salt for AES session storage (wire format v=2, v=1 still decrypts).
- LICENSE, SECURITY.md, vulnerability disclosure policy.
- `docs/AUDIT.md` — full 166-finding audit with severity table.

### Added — web parity
- First-run password setup + change-password flow entirely from the browser; CLI is no longer required for security setup.
- 4-step web wizard for adding Telegram accounts (label → phone → OTP → 2FA).
- Account list / remove from Settings → Telegram Accounts.
- `/api/monitor/{status,start,stop}` + Settings → Engine card with live state, queue, active workers, uptime.
- History backfill from the Group settings modal (one-tap 100 / 1k / 10k).
- Dialogs picker covers archived chats and (opt-in) DMs.

### Added — features
- **Download by Link** (`POST /api/download/url`): paste any `t.me/.../<msg>`, `/c/<id>/<msg>`, `/c/<id>/<topic>/<msg>`, `tg://resolve`, or `tg://privatepost` URL and pull just that media.
- **Telegram Stories**: username + per-story selection, queued through the regular downloader.
- **TTL/self-destructing media**: monitor detects `media.ttlSeconds` and front-loads the queue so the file is captured before expiry.
- **Forum topics**: per-group filter list with whitelist mode.
- **Proxy** (SOCKS4/5 + MTProxy) wired into the GramJS client; Settings UI with TCP-reachability test.
- **Light / Dark / Auto theme** with OS-detected default, persisted in localStorage.
- **Browser notifications** opt-in for download-complete events.
- **Sticky status bar**: monitor state, queue, active workers, total files, disk usage, WS link.
- **Gallery search + multi-select + bulk delete**, including server-side `searchDownloads()`.

### Added — engine
- Dual-lane queue (`_high` realtime + `queue` history) — realtime no longer competes with backfill; spillover only displaces history.
- `core/runtime.js` singleton orchestrates monitor + downloader + forwarder in-process for the web server.
- WebSocket client (`ws.js`) with auto-reconnect and visibility-aware backoff.
- Connection manager `stop()` + monitor cleanup tracking; intervals are `unref`-ed so the process can exit cleanly.
- Backpressure max-wait in history (5 minutes) so a stuck downloader can't hang the command forever.

### Changed
- `runner.js` and `watchdog.ps1` now read `TGDL_RUN` env (default `monitor`) instead of hard-coding `history` — production supervision actually keeps a long-running process alive.
- gramJS internal noise (`TIMEOUT`, `Not connected`, `Reconnect`, etc.) is now classified instead of silently dropped: it logs to `data/logs/network.log` and only surfaces in stderr when `TGDL_DEBUG=1`.

### Fixed
- Terminal raw-mode is restored on `exit` / SIGINT / SIGTERM — no more dead shells on crash.
- Plaintext apiId no longer printed at CLI startup.
- `.gitignore` malformed line removed; `docs/` is now tracked.
- Orphan `src/index.js_fragment_setupWebAuth` deleted.

### Migration notes
- Old `config.web.password` (plaintext) is auto-rehashed to `config.web.passwordHash` on first successful web login.
- Old AES blob format (`v=1`) keeps decrypting; new writes are `v=2`.
- Existing `data/db.sqlite` is migrated forward automatically — `ttl_seconds` and `file_hash` columns are added on first start.
