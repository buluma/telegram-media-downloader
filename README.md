## ✨ Why Use This Tool?

1.  **Zero-Loss Monitoring:** Our **Hybrid Engine** (Real-time Events + Active Polling) ensures you never miss a single photo or video, even in fast-moving groups.

3.  **Automated Mirroring:** Automatically **Auto Forward** media from source channels to your own private cloud or group instantly.

## ❓ Troubleshooting & FAQ

### Q: Why does it say "FloodWait"?
**A:** This is Telegram's server-side rate limit. If you download too fast, Telegram pauses you. The bot detects this and will **automatically pause and resume** when safe. Do not restart the bot manually; just let it wait.

### Q: Can I run this on a VPS (Ubuntu/Debian)?
**A:** Yes! It is fully compatible with Linux. Use `npm run monitor` for headless mode, or use `pm2` to keep it running 24/7.

### Q: My "All Media" count is wrong in the Web UI.
**A:** We recently updated the engine to support **Unlimited Files**. Please refresh the page; the count is now exact.

### Q: "Forward Dest" says `null` in CLI?
**A:** This means you haven't selected a specific destination, so the bot uses the **Default Storage Channel**. It will auto-create a private channel named "Telegram Downloader Storage" for you.
