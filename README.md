## Why Telegram Media Downloader

Telegram channels and groups often contain valuable media -- photos, videos, documents, and audio files -- that you may want to archive or back up locally. This tool solves that problem by:

- **Monitoring channels in real-time** and downloading new media as it appears.
- **Batch downloading history** from channels with thousands of past messages.
- **Organizing files automatically** into folders by group name and media type.
- **Preventing duplicates** using a SQLite database to track every download.
- **Providing a Web Dashboard** for browsing, managing, and viewing downloaded media without touching the command line.

Unlike Telegram bots, this tool uses the Telegram User API (MTProto) via GramJS, which means it can access any channel or group your account is a member of, including private ones.

---

    `-- videos/
```

File naming convention: `{ISO-timestamp}_{telegram-message-id}.{extension}`

---

## Data Management and Purge

The downloader includes a purge system for cleaning up downloaded data. Purge operations are available from both the Web Dashboard and the CLI.

### Per-Group Purge

Deletes all data associated with a specific group:
- Downloaded files on disk (the entire group folder)
- Database records (downloads and queue tables)
- Group configuration entry
- Cached profile photo

**Web Dashboard:** Hover over a group in the sidebar and click the delete button, or use `DELETE /api/groups/:id/purge`.

**CLI:** Run `node src/index.js purge` and select the group to delete.

### Factory Reset (Purge All)

Deletes all application data:
- All download folders and files
- All database records
- All group configurations
- All cached profile photos

**Web Dashboard:** Go to Settings, scroll to the Danger Zone section, and click "Purge All Data".

**CLI:** Run `node src/index.js purge` and select "DELETE ALL DATA".

---

## Security

### Session Encryption
- A unique `data/secret.key` is generated automatically on first launch.
- The Telegram session is encrypted with AES-256-CBC using this key.
- Back up `secret.key` if you move your installation. Without it, the session cannot be decrypted and you will need to re-authenticate.

### Web Dashboard Authentication
- Password protection is optional and can be enabled via `npm run auth` or the CLI.
- Passwords are hashed with SHA-256 before storage.
- Session cookies are used for browser authentication.
- Sensitive fields (API Hash, passwords) are stripped from all API responses.

### Production Best Practices
- Do not expose port 3000 to the public internet without authentication enabled.
- Use a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, Traefik) with HTTPS/TLS for production deployments.
- Keep `data/secret.key` and `data/config.json` out of version control.
- Consider running behind a firewall and whitelisting only trusted IPs.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Session Expired (403 or 401 Errors)

**Cause:** Your Telegram session has expired or become invalid.

**Solution:** Re-authenticate by running `npm start`. For Docker deployments:
```bash
docker-compose run telegram-downloader npm start
```

### FloodWait Errors

**Cause:** Telegram is rate-limiting your requests because too many API calls were made in a short period.

**Solution:** The application handles FloodWait automatically by pausing for the required duration. Do not restart the application repeatedly. If FloodWait occurs frequently, lower your `concurrent` and `requestsPerMinute` settings.

### Docker Permission Issues

**Cause:** The container cannot write to the mounted `data/` directory.

**Solution:** Ensure the directory is owned by the correct user:
```bash
chown -R 1000:1000 data
```

### Database Locked

**Cause:** Multiple instances are trying to access the SQLite database simultaneously.

**Solution:** Ensure only one instance (CLI or Web) is running at a time. For production, use `runner.js` which manages a single process with automatic restart.

### Downloads Not Starting

**Cause:** The group is not configured or monitoring is disabled for that group.

**Solution:**
1. Run `node src/index.js config` and verify the group is enabled.
2. Check that the media type filters allow the file types you expect to download.
3. Check the console output for error messages or FloodWait warnings.

### Web Dashboard Shows 0 Files

**Cause:** Browser cache or outdated client-side JavaScript.

**Solution:** Hard refresh the browser with Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (macOS) to reload the latest JavaScript.

### Group Name Shows as ID Number

**Cause:** The group was downloaded before the group name tracking feature was added.

**Solution:** Restart the web server or CLI. On startup, the application automatically backfills group names from your configuration into existing database records.

## FAQ

**Q: How do I get Telegram API credentials?**

A: Visit https://my.telegram.org, sign in with your phone number, go to "API development tools", and create a new application. You will receive an API ID (number) and API Hash (string). Both are free.

**Q: Is this a Telegram Bot?**

A: No. This tool uses the Telegram User API (MTProto protocol) via GramJS. It authenticates as your user account, not as a bot. No bot token is required.

**Q: Can I monitor private channels and groups?**

A: Yes, as long as your Telegram account is a member of the channel or group.

**Q: How much disk space does it use?**

A: It depends on the channels you monitor and the media types you download. Use the `diskManagement.maxTotalSize` setting to set a hard limit (e.g., "50GB" or "1TB"). The dashboard shows real-time disk usage.

**Q: Can I run this on a VPS or cloud server?**

A: Yes. Use Docker Compose or the `npm run prod` command with the built-in watchdog for automatic restarts. Consider running behind a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy) with HTTPS for secure remote access.

**Q: Does it download old messages or only new ones?**

A: The `monitor` command watches for new messages in real-time. To download past messages, use the `history` command which supports date ranges, message count limits, and per-group media type filters.

**Q: Can I forward downloaded media to another channel automatically?**

A: Yes. Configure Auto-Forward in the group settings through the Web Dashboard or CLI. You can forward to Saved Messages (`"me"`), a specific channel or group (by ID), or a configured storage channel.

**Q: Can I delete all data and start fresh?**

A: Yes. Use the purge feature from the Web Dashboard (Settings > Danger Zone) or the CLI (`node src/index.js purge`). Per-group deletion and full factory reset are both supported.

**Q: Will my Telegram account get banned?**

A: The tool includes built-in rate limiting, FloodWait handling, and human-like delays to minimize risk. However, using any unofficial Telegram client carries some risk. Follow the recommended rate limit settings and avoid downloading from too many groups simultaneously.
